Here are a couple of quick one-liners we use in scripts to feed data to nagios.

One of the problems we ran into was a bug in the AIX 5.3 snmp daemon that reporting some values improperly (mainly cpu but we decided to use nrpe and custom scripts)

    Percentage of memory in use::

        # svmon | grep memory | awk '{ print ($3/$2)*100 }'
        50.3664

    Percentage of swap in use::

        # lsps -a | grep rootvg | awk '{print $5}'
        10

These numbers are reported back to Nagios via NRPE
