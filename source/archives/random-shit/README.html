I don't have an interface for this yet. I just simply haven't had the time.
For now, you can just download any files here.

Also, you may notice some odd text constructs in my .txt files. These are
markups for <a href="http://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.html">Vim
reStructured Text</a>
I use this to markup my text files. It only works with version 7 of Vim.

Thanks,
