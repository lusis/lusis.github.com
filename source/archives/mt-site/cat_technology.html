<span class="title">Why I'll never buy another Linksys Product</span>

<p>I won't ever buy another linksys product.</p>


<p>It's pretty simple really. I'm tired of dealing with the Linksys idea of changing something as essential as the chipset without changing the model number.</p>

<p>This came up at work as we are working to migrate our workstations to Linux.</p>

<p>Our current install base of well over 600 Windows PCs with Linksys WMP11 cards is useless under Linux. You see Linksys has decided in thier wisdom to continually change the chipset used in these cards and not let anyone know (not even on the box) that the cards aren't the same. </p>

<p>The older models of WMP11 (version 1 and 2) work fine under Linux. The newer cards (version 3) do not. </p>

<p>At this point we told our Linksys rep we were dropping them in favor of D-Link. The USB wireless keyfobs work under Linux, are cheaper to replace (no hardware tech needed on site) and D-Link has assured me that since this is the only product line they have that works under Mac OSX, they plan on keeping it. I made my distaste with Linksys VERY clear to our new D-Link rep.</p>

<p>But the Linksys problem isn't simply applicable to the wireless card product line. It also leaks over into the WAP line as well. Currently at each of these locations we have a Linksys WAP11 access point. The model we have seems to have a nasty bug whereby you MUST input the Netmask and the gateway in the IP configuration screen in reverse order (i.e. the Netmask goes in the gateway section and vice-versa)!</p>

<p>This is insane. So I check the Linksys website for updated firmware that would surely resolve this minor but seemlingly easy flaw to fix. Check this page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linksys.com/download/">http://www.linksys.com/download/</a></p>

<p>They have 4 different versions of this damn access point with the same name!</p>

<p>How am I supposed to know which of the 4 I have when I have over 300 of these guys out there? It seems the only way is to compare the firmware version on the AP with the firmware on each model. IF the numbers are close enough you can bet that you found the right one.</p>

<p>So I go through this and find out that Linksys hasn't updated the firmware for the AP we have since August of last year! I'm guessing they don't want to bother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I'm taking my business from Linksys to D-Link (and Netgear if need be) to avoid this kind of shoddy business. I expect more from Cisco. Then again I'm slowly replacing all my cisco switches with HP5308XL and 2924 models.</p>

<p><a title="" href="http://lusis.org/static/userContent.css" title="Block ads now!">My userContent.css for Mozilla based browsers</a></p>


<p>So I added a few entries to the file recently and wanted to update them.</p>

<p>First off is a nice little hack to block flash ads. It applies to all flash content though. Any site that has flash on it, will get a button in place of the flash that says "Click here to play flash". It comes in handy on Yahoo! and a few other sites that abuse flash as an advertising medium.</p>

<p>The other hacks are more entries to block specific adserver strings.</p>

<p>If anyone has directions on how to get this working with IE or opera, I'd be interested to see it. Both browsers allow you to use a custom stylesheet but I think some of the lines in the file are gecko specific.</p>

<p>As always, refer to my <a href="http://www.lusis.org/mt/lusis/archives/2003_03.html#000087" title="The original article mentioning how to install the file">original post on the matter</a></p>

<span class="title">Well it's official</span>

<p><a title="AOL Kills Netscape | Metafilter" href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/27002">AOL Kills Netscape | Metafilter</a></p>


<p>It seems that AOL has finally done what everyone THOUGHT they would do years ago..they&apos;ve killed netscape. All the nifty slashdot jokes about it being official are actually true now - Netscape is dead.</p>

<p>I've linked to the MeFi article on this because one can usually find good discussion there. Either way, there are articles and blog entries ALL over the web. <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com" title="CSS god">Eric Meyer</a> has his own inside take on the matter as well.</p>

<p>The gist of the matter is this. A product named Netscape no longer exists. The <strong>core</strong> of Netscape, known as Mozilla is still going strong. This is one of the joys of opensource. Some of the mozteam have formed the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Now with new marketing layouts!">Mozilla Foundation</a>, a non-profit group that will fund further Mozilla development partly with a 2 million dollar donation from AOL and other contributions from Sun and IBM (who have already hired a few core moz developers to work on the project.</p>

<p>What is interesting to note about the whole thing is that AOL <strong>JUST</strong> signed a deal with Microsoft to use Internet Explorer in the AOL product for the next seven years.</p>

<p>I&apos;m curious how this will play out considering that Microsoft also just announced that IE will no longer be provided as a standalone browser product. It will be forever more incorporated into Windows and new versions only available with a new operating system upgrade.</p>

<p>I have a few thoughts related to the future of web standards here. As someone who occassionally does a web page here and there, I'm bummed that I have to tolerate and support the broken IE6 png and css issues forever. You may ask why forever? Well I don't know of anyone who will upgrade an OS just to get a new browser. Of course a large percentage of the new browsers will be distributed with new computer purchases but how many independant developers are going to be able to afford the latest OS upgrade from Microsoft just to test out a website? Not many will spend. This is good news for web developers (allthough it could bite them in the ass). Develop for the standards compliant browsers on the market. Opera, Mozilla and Safari. I know there are more out there but they are mostly based on the core of either KHTML (in the case of Safari and Konq for KDE) or Gecko (in the case of Mozilla, Firebird, Galeon, Chimera, Epiphany et al). After that go back and see how it looks in IE6. You should also check IE55 (as broken as it is) for a little while longer.</p>

<p>You should be pretty safe if you do that. I'm curious to see what nasty little proprietary extensions MS will add to IE7+ though.</p>

<p>As for me, I have to do some family computer work this weekend and I plan on putting Mozilla on both machines and show them the pop-up blocking features. This is the kind of thing that will sway users to Mozilla and others over IE. </p>

<p>Why pay for a popup blocker when you can get one for free? Why pay for an OS upgrade to get a popup blocker when you can get one for free?</p>

<p>Comments are welcome and, yes, I'm still working on my new layout. Be sure and comment there as well.</p>

<p>The least DC can do is send a response to the mail when it's rejected for chrissakes. This isn't so much of a problem with mail filtering as it is with the specifics used at DC.</p>

<p>At our office, when an email is rejected for content reasons, the sender knows it. Whether it's blocked by the SBL (which gives an SMTP error that any sender will see) or the antivirus box kicks back a message saying why the message was rejected.</p>

<p>I'm really curious as to what system the DC folks are even using.</p>

<p>I finally got around to actually READING an article on the whole dolphin thing. Check it out. It's really cool.</p>

<p>I honestly thought they used the dolphins to set the mines off. Seemed like such a waste. These guys are trained, not only to find mines, but also drop tethers and swim back to the ships and push buttons.</p>

<p>The Navy also has sea lions and two white whales. ROCK ON!</p>

<p>Okay I'm miffed.</p>


<p>I was doing a normal emerge on my home system (gentoo) and upgraded glibc. It seems that codeweavers crossover AND transgaming winex are now borked. It's not a HUGE deal (I can't remember the last time I actually NEEDED the quicktime plugin under linux and I use my laptop to play Ultima Online since UOAssist doesn't play well with WineX.) but it's still annoying.  </p>

<p>What gets me is I went from glibc-2.3.1 to glibc-2.3.2. How much could have changed in a freaking DOT RELEASE?</p>

<p>I'm not so sure that the Transgaming people are willing to help out on the matter. The answer about it being b0rked came from the codeweaver team who actually seem to care about the customers. I'm not a big fan of the Transgaming method of supporting games.  Sure the vote method is nice but when it comes down to me just wanting UOAssist to work, it doesn't do much good. My hope is that whatever fixes are integrated into WineX 3.0 will automatically fix it.</p>

<p>My REAL problem with Transgaming is the release schedule. It seems the keep tabs on when the majority of the subscriptions are expiring and then they don't release until AFTER that date. Sort of a microcosm of the whole subscription software model. At least the old version doesn't expire.</p>

<p>I REALLY like the method that The Kompany uses with Kapital. I get a non-redistributable copy of the Kapital sourcecode to build myself if the precompiled ones don't work. I understand that Transgaming has Safedisc code to worry about but that could be handled like Nvidia does where those libs must be downloaded alone and integrated at compile time.</p>

<p>Who knows. If anyone has any tips on the glibc problem or can assure me that downgrading my glibc is safe, I would appreciate it!</p>

<p>Interesting note on politechbot about spam.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04371.html">Here is the original</a></p>

<p>What I find interesting is the section about azgoogle and the numbers that come up:</p>

<p><i>2. I blocked all traffic from the well-known spammers at azoogle.com<br />
nearly a year ago.  My mail servers return the correct response codes to<br />
every SMTP connection from them, indicating that access has been permanently<br />
denied; the text message which accompanies it indicates why.  However,<br />
they're still pounding away multiple times per day, every day, on every<br />
mail server I have.  A small sample of abridged log entries from the<br />
last 24 hours:</p>

<p>Jan 19 16:49:03 sendmail: arg1=transport23b.azoogle.com, <br />
arg2=66.197.140.226, reject=550 5.0.0<br />
Jan 19 17:23:41 sendmail: arg1=transport23e.azoogle.com, <br />
arg2=66.197.140.229, reject=550 5.0.0<br />
Jan 20 09:06:19 sendmail: arg1=transport12c.azoogle.com, <br />
arg2=66.197.140.72, reject=550 5.0.0</p>

<p>I have 12,814 more log entries just like that in my archives.<br />
</i></p>

<p>It happens to me as well. The response code I return is always permanently rejected and yet host after host says screw you and keeps trying to send mail. See <a href="http://www.lusis.org/mt/lusis/archives/2002_04.html#000044">here</a> for an example.</p>

<p>Maybe this is where someone needs to test the legal waters and sue using the DoS argument.  Or hell even plain-jane theft of resources. What about harrasment charges?</p>

<p>Think about it. If my mailserver says "No. I do not wish to accept mail from you EVER again.", how is it different from an ex-whatever filing for a restraining order? Maybe we need digital restraining orders of some sort.</p>

<p>I like this!</p>


<p>I started futzing around with some various stylesheets. I really wanted to avoid tables as well.</p>

<p>I finally came across <a href="http://blogstyles.com/">BlogStyles</a>.</p>

<p>They had a three column layout that I liked alot. Since they were free for all, I took it and modified a few colors. I hope it's readable and loads nicely. My understanding and personal experience is that the only browser it DOESN'T load properly on is IE4.5 on Mac. </p>

<p>Anyone with a Mac has probably upgraded browsers by now anyway. Especially with Safari hanging around. I'll verify that it works okay when rendered with KHTML (which Safari uses) when I get home tonight.</p>

<p>It's all based in css so any browser that behaves should be able to read it.</p>

<p>Bother me if it doesn't work for you. I'd like to test it out myself</p>

<p>The gallery has been upgraded and templated in with the rest of the site.<br />
You can get to it from the link on the left or from <a href="http://www.lusis.org/gallery">here</a></p>

<span class="title">Screenshot - Antialiased and all</span>

<p>I'm just so proud that all the compiling finished that I had to take a screenshot.</p>


<p>Here's the lowdown. I got tired of my current look. I really wanted AA fonts in Mozilla. After a few false starts, I basically recompiled EVERYTHING from source off the redhat 8 SRPM cd's. There were a few hiccups along the way but when I was finished, I had a nice new install of Gnome2 complete with AA fonts all over the place. </p>

<p>I'm using 1.2b since Moz recalled on 1.2final. As soon as it's out again, I'll build it.</p>

<p>The fonts on my desktop are all fancy because I wanted them to be. The title bar fonts are a little LESS fancy. The actual application font is good old arial.</p>

<p>I recompiled my kernel with the latest ck patches (ck-15) and enabled low-latency and preempt. I built EVERYTHING with "-O3 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer". I figured those were nice safe flags. Since I'm still using gcc-2.96 I can't take advantage of the other fancy stuff that gcc3 has to offer. </p>

<p>The only thing I left as normal was xterm. I'm using a nice solid vga font. I can't deal with AA in a term window. It just doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips about dual running gcc296 and gcc3 on RH7.3 I'd be glad to hear it. The only reason I can't move to RH8.0 fully is a naughty bug in Kapital, which I use to manage my finances. As soon as The Kompany gets that fixed, I'm good to go though. Yes, I even tried recompiling Kapital but the bug is still there. Methinks it's a bug with QT/KDE that RedHat uses on 8.0.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here are the links to everything I used and did. Oh yeah and that handy screenshot! Any questions, shoot me an email - articles at lusis dot org</p>

- I have two checking accounts, a savings account and a credit card account and all 4 work flawlessly in Mozilla. Rock on!<br />
- I put both filetypes on the screenshots. Are there any browsers in use that DON'T support PNG properly?<br />
- The focus is all wack in the screenshots because the gnome screenshot application takes all focus when in use. Thus no active title bars in the shot<br />
- The themes I use for Metacity and Gtk2 are LighthouseBlue. It was created by Jar in response to comments from Eugenia Loli-Queru at OSNews.com on her review of RedHat 8.0<br />
- I can build RH7.3 compliant SRPMS of everything if anyone is interested.<br />
- The song I was listening to on xmms was "Twist" by Korn. Yes I own "Life is Peachy" so bite me RIAA.<br />
- Total build time without stupid hiccups on my part ( changing build archs hardcoded into various SRPMS) was around 3 days. Let's just say I didn't use my machine much and spent alot of time on the laptop ;) It was worth it though.</p>

<span class="title">K5 spam</span>

<p>I get alot of spam. I mean alot. But sometimes I get a spam that makes me wonder WHAT in the hell someone was thinking?</p>


<p>This came to me via K5. When I say via K5, i mean some stupid bot scoured kuro5hin and snagged my email address.</p>

<p>This is why I have my own domain. I can use a different email for whatever the occasion.</p>

<p>Today's occasion is leeches. Or at least that's what some kind soul in Russia wants me to read about:</p>

<p>I've taken a bit of care with the people cc'd on this email. I masked all but the funny addresses. What I mean by funny is email addresses that were created SPECIFICALLY to avoid spam. I'm guessing it did the job because the attempted to mail the false addresses anyway.</p>

<p>I will give poor Valery credit, it's the most targetted bit of junk mail I've ever gotten. I VAGUELY remember participating in such a discussion on K5 at some point allthough my endless searching has turned up no such details.</p>

<span class="title">When mail servers go bad</span>

<p>Is it so hard to write an MTA that follows protocols?</p>


<p>This text is from a report on our company mailserver. I've cleaned it up a bit to remove some email addys. You would think that once my mailserver rejects the message, we would be done but NO. It seems some mailservers actually keep talking. I've gotten several of these lately. One report actually had the FULL spam, line by line.</p>

<p>Just plain crazy!</p>

<span class="title">Sendmail stuff</span>

<p>Sendmail sucks</p>


<p>I've been f'ing around with sendmail to make some spam changes. I might or might not have messed up the mailserver. All this in light of my nifty post on slashdot. Actually it's just some virtual user stuff. If any of my users have any problem getting mail or mail showing up in the from field to other people, let me know. I'll take a whack at fixing it.</p>

<p>Update: Sendmail sucks so much I'm going to install postfix tonight. Mail services will be down for a bit whilst I do all that.</p>

<p>At least that's what I thought until I walked into work this morning.</p>


<p>Actually I didn't get a virus but when I walked into work this morning, my daily scan from Norton Antivirus assured me that I did.</p>

<p>It seems that the zlib dll that cygwin installs is now the same name as a virus backdoor.</p>

<p>Norton antivirus was happy to quarantine cygz.dll on my behalf, thinking that it was a virus. After assuring myself with a few google searches, I unquarantined the file and went on my merry way.</p>

<p>I'm actually going to fire off an email to both symantec and the cygwin folks about the whole thing.</p>

<span class="title">Gotta love IBM</span>

<p>"Why would someone that good, play for nothing?"</p>


<p>"Because he loves the game. He loves the game"</p>

<p>Basically the commercial is a bunch of guys playing basketball. On each person's uniform is a name like "wireless" or "web" or "ecommerce".</p>

<p>The coach introduces the newest teamate "Linux" to the team. He procedes to pull a MJ (pre-Washington Wizards Jordon) and dunk all over the place. The quotes above are from a meeting that two guys are having about the new guy.</p>

<p>I have to tell you this is the best commercial for linux yet. "The Hiest" was cool and all but this really smacks it to the PHB's saying that something free can't be any good.</p>

<p>Rock on IBM!</p>

<span class="title">Sometimes I hate software vendors.</span>

<p>It seems they go out of thier way to piss of network admins.</p>


<p>Let's take for example one <a href="http://www.webex.com">WebEx</a></p>

<p>This is from <a href="http://www.maxagrid.com/Technical/WebEx/WebExSecurity.html">Maxagrid.com</a>  about the WebEx plugin:</p>

<p><i>When establishing this connection, the client first attempts to connect using TCP port 1270. If this port is blocked by a firewall, the client will tunnel the communications using HTTP port 80. Establishing communications in this manner eliminates the need to reconfigure firewalls to take advantage of the meeting center. This helps ensure compliance with corporate firewall policies for optimal security. The WebEx client is firewall friendly and will work seamlessly with proxy servers and firewall deployments.</i></p>

<p>Note that WebEx will happily tunnel through http if it can't get a direct connection!</p>

<p><b>DAMNIT I DON'T WANT IT TO TUNNEL THROUGH HTTP!</b></p>

<p>I am tired of everyone and his uncle writing applications that will "happily" tunnel through http. I have a network to run. I have my job on the line in relation to security and this network. Why can't these damn companies work WITH firewall developers and not against them? I had the hardest damn time just blocking gnutella and other P2P apps. Now many of the slashdot ilk will tell me  I shouldn't block them but most of those people are 12 and have never worked in a corporate environment much less flipped a burger at the local Arby's.</p>

<p>Understand this software developers. The network of another company is not yours to play around with.  If I have to, I will block every damn class C I find that does this crap. I did it with napster and I did it with the Gnutella hubs and I did it with Musiccity and I'll damn sure block any traffic with squid to any regex that even REMOTLY matches WebEx. It's all I have left to do.</p>

<p>Users. You are at work to (duh!) work. Downloading the latest fucking movie off Morpheus is not your job. That is unless you work for those wanker companies that scan P2P for copyright (what a joke) violations. </p>

<p>Maybe we'll get to the point (aren't we there yet with stateful inspection?) that can block a packet based on the packet itself. I'd love to see that implemented into ipf, pf or iptables at some point. I don't care that I need a beefy box to be my firewall as long as I can say I've done my best to block unwanted traffic.</p>

<p>I guess I'm done now ranting and I still don't feel any better. WebEx, you can blow me and I'm off to write a regex for Squid.<br />

<p>Okay I'm just gonna start blocking all the asian countries.</p>


<p>I'm tempted to just block all .cn , .kr , .jp and anything else that I can think of. The only thing I've ever gotten emailed from those domains is spam. Nothing else. If anyone who get's mail on this server has any objections, let me know by midnight tonight. Otherwise, monday morning I'm going to block them with ipchains or something more at the router level.</p>

<p>It's my mailserver anyway ;)</p>

<span class="title">Gotta love RedHat!</span>

<p>Sometimes I wonder why I use redhat at all. Hell I started with Slackware.</p>


<p>Check out this little nugget of wisdom. It comes from a fresh install of Redhat 7.1 server. I was removing some unwanted packages that were not really needed (i.e. the rest of the kitchen sink)</p>

<p>In the process of removing some of above packages I had this little conundrum:<br />
<b><br />
[root@demobox /root]# rpm -e ypbind<br />
error: removing these packages would break dependencies:<br />
        ypbind is needed by yp-tools-2.4-7<br />
[root@demobox /root]# rpm -e yp-tools<br />
error: removing these packages would break dependencies:<br />
        yp-tools is needed by ypbind-1.7-6<br />
</b></p>

<p>Thank god for rpm -e --nodeps, eh?</p>

<span class="title">MS vs. DOJ: True Innovation</span>

<p>This article was reprinted on linux.com several years ago when Microsoft was being taken to court.</p>


<p>MS vs DOJ: True Innovation</p>

<p>[from the lusis.org rants archive]</p>

<p>Im a geek. More specifically, Im a computer geek. I use Linux</p>

<p>and I like it. I advocate it whenever possible. The only reason I</p>

<p>say all this is to somehow qualify me for what I am about to</p>

<p>write. Anyone could write this and most already have, but I</p>

<p>want to offer my viewpoint. Of course Im talking about the</p>

<p>Microsoft anti-trust trial.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I dont like Microsoft for the most part. You see Im a network</p>

<p>administrator. I deal with all flavors of UNIX and all flavors of</p>

<p>Microsoft platforms. There are days, like the ones I had this</p>

<p>past week, in which I curse Bill Gates and his company with</p>

<p>every breath. I curse the fact that they have taken proven</p>

<p>standards and done just enough to make them non-standard.</p>

<p>I curse the fact that everything has to be so convoluted when</p>

<p>all I really would prefer to do is edit a configuration file and</p>

<p>restart a service. I want log files that I can "tail -f" and see</p>

<p>exactly what is happening. I want control over my servers.</p>

<p>Microsoft has taken that control away.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then I stop to clear my head and realize that, if not for</p>

<p>Microsoft, I probably would not be in the position I am today.</p>

<p>Of course we used Apple IIs when I was in grade school and I</p>

<p>learned BASIC on an Aquarius (anyone remember those?),</p>

<p>but that was about the extent of my computer knowledge until</p>

<p>I graduated from high school. I didnt have a PC at home until</p>

<p>after I graduated. When I did get back into computing it was</p>

<p>with DOS and a bit later, Windows 3.1. It all came naturally to</p>

<p>me. I think that the ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) helped a</p>

<p>bit. I decided to pursue my MCSE. I even passed Windows NT</p>

<p>3.51 Server and Workstation. But I discovered Linux and since</p>

<p>that day my knowledge has grown tenfold. No longer was</p>

<p>everything handed to me on a plate. I had to figure things out</p>

<p>on my own and it was A Good Thing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But it started with Microsoft. Whatever you think about</p>

<p>Microsofts business practices, you cant deny the many</p>

<p>positive things they have done for the world of personal</p>

<p>computers. Some would argue that we would have gotten</p>

<p>there eventually, but how long would it have taken? Would we</p>

<p>still be in an era of command-line operating systems (not that</p>

<p>there is anything wrong with that)? Would the landscape of</p>

<p>technology be where it is today if it were not for a company</p>

<p>like Microsoft forcing its way into the world? I dont think so.</p>

<p>You can thank Bill Gates for getting the PC into homes and</p>

<p>making it easy enough for the average Joe. Now you may say</p>

<p>"what about Steve Jobs and Apple?" I say that things would</p>

<p>be farther behind if the desktop market were controlled by</p>

<p>Apple. Dont get me wrong, I like Apple too, but at least with</p>

<p>Microsoft you get a command shell (no matter how useless it</p>

<p>is). Lets not turn this into a flame war on operating systems,</p>

<p>though. This is my opinion, however useless you may find it to</p>

<p>be.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Getting back to the matter at hand, what "good" has Microsoft</p>

<p>accomplished? Whenever I get frustrated and think that we</p>

<p>would all be better off without Windows, I think about a</p>

<p>commercial that Microsoft put out last year. Its with one about</p>

<p>Microsoft developers talking about making computers</p>

<p>accessible to the handicapped. At the end of the commercial</p>

<p>you see the developer grabbing his cane and finding his way</p>

<p>out the door. He is blind, you see. Innovation costs ... a lot.</p>

<p>Microsoft has the money to back it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Is Microsoft a monopoly? Definitely. Do they deserve to be</p>

<p>punished? Oh yes. Did Windows NT breed a generation of</p>

<p>worthless system administrators who can do nothing but</p>

<p>regurgitate information that would get them nowhere if the</p>

<p>problem fell outside what theyve learned? You betcha. Is Bill</p>

<p>Gates the anti-Christ? No. You and I both know this. Of</p>

<p>course he used his muscle and money to kill smaller</p>

<p>companies, absorb others and destroy anyone who got in his</p>

<p>way, but you cant deny that he is a smart businessman. He</p>

<p>knew what it would take to make computing a part of</p>

<p>everyday life.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I think we are now at the point where we can do without</p>

<p>Windows. The worlds technology sector has evolved to the</p>

<p>point that if Microsoft were to disappear, someone else could</p>

<p>easily step in and fill the market for a consumer operating</p>

<p>system. Linux, xBSD and others have already started</p>

<p>replacing the server market. With that we get a new</p>

<p>generation of system administrators and network</p>

<p>administrators who actually know what they are doing and can</p>

<p>do more than point and click. But as for the desktop market,</p>

<p>we will never get that. I wouldnt install a Linux machine for my</p>

<p>mother to use as her computer at home. Not yet anyway. She</p>

<p>doesnt want to know the internals. She wants to send e-mail,</p>

<p>browse the Web and write documents that she can share with</p>

<p>others. She wants one-touch scanning for her pictures.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What should the government do at this point? Fine Billy Boy</p>

<p>and his crew? It wouldnt matter if they did. Theyll recoup the</p>

<p>fine in less than a year. Force them to open up the source</p>

<p>code? I dont want the government to have that kind of control</p>

<p>over a company, Microsoft or otherwise. Our hallowed leaders</p>

<p>have already proven that they just dont get it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So what do they do then? I say they should break up the</p>

<p>company. Split up into two divisions: Operating Systems and</p>

<p>Applications. The judge has argued in his finding of facts that</p>

<p>Microsoft has hurt the consumer market. If you force them to</p>

<p>break up, we may see more innovation from the applications</p>

<p>group like never before. They would not be restricted to coding</p>

<p>for Windows only. We may see open file formats that people</p>

<p>can use. Think about how much better StarOffice and similar</p>

<p>projects would be if an applications branch could release file</p>

<p>specs openly without fear of angering the gods on high? This</p>

<p>would allow for more competition. If the applications branch</p>

<p>wants to make money, they will have to cater to all popular</p>

<p>operating systems, not just Windows and Macintosh. I would</p>

<p>buy a copy of Office for Linux, if it were available. I need</p>

<p>compatibility with the rest of the office when it comes to</p>

<p>document sharing, spreadsheet sharing and the like. I would</p>

<p>buy a copy of "Age of Empires: Age of Kings" for Linux if it</p>

<p>were available.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You may disagree with everything that Ive said here. You</p>

<p>may say that I am a secret Microsoft mole sent to cloud the</p>

<p>minds of the true believers. I say to you, go back and read the</p>

<p>Advocacy HOWTO. Each OS has its place. Windows had its</p>

<p>place and still does. Break Microsoft up and let them really</p>

<p>innovate. </p>
