...
Many people see this as a threat to the social bond and a sign of the failure of our integration model. This may well have been a significant factor in our government&apos;s decision to adopt its stance in the UN. Anything that would stir tensions between communities is regarded as a bad thing for our country. We already see too many people overtly supporting Saddam or shouting anti-semitic slogans in anti-war protests. And believe it or not, this is a real concern for us."

<p><a title="The Googlewashing Of Our Language" href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=59548&cid=5657709">The Googlewashing Of Our Language</a></p>


<p>Well the original story was about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/03/2327239&tid=95" title="googlewashing and second superpowers">Googlewashing</a> but it was in the context of the phrase "second superpower".</p>

<p>After reading the second superpower article, I had a bit of an itch to scratch. My language was probably less than productive but I really had to scratch! I got a wonderful response from ThinWhiteDuke who happens to be French.</p>

<p>As usual, I've quoted Thomas Jefferson way too much. I've also stepped outside of a rational discussion at some point with my choice of words .</p>
