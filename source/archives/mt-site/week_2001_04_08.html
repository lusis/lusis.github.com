<p>[Editors note - as if Im really an editor - I dont normally post personal correspondance to the public but this just came out of me this afternoon. Someone sent me an email and asked me if I were ever serious since Im always sarchastic. I wanted the rest of the world to because getting this honest is semi-painful and yet feels so damn good sometimes.]</p>

<p><br />
Im going to be serious here for a moment. Im actually a very serious person<br />
when it comes to alot of things. I find humour disarms most people so thats<br />
my schtick as it were. I have a very intense life at times. Hell my life is<br />
intense most of the time. Im a deep person is what it comes down to. (ignore<br />
the dangling preposition).</p>

<p><br />
Lets see. My brain works entirely too hard. I overthink EVERYTHING in life. I<br />
want to get married and settle down and have kids and have a life and have<br />
someone special I can talk to about anything and everything. I want alot of<br />
things but that eternal companionship is what I really want more than<br />
anything.</p>

<p><br />
I have bills. I have some debt. I regret not having finished college. I regret<br />
not having the money nor anyone to provide it for me to finish college.</p>

<p><br />
I was almost a youth minister. I have deep seated feelings regarding religion.<br />
I think about politics too much. I worry about where the world is going and<br />
how corporations are doing everything in thier power to restrict my rights and<br />
yet, as a capitalist, I think they have a right to make money.</p>

<p><br />
Im tired of the US being the worlds bitch (pardon my not-so-frenchy french).<br />
im tired of everyone but me and the people I care about trying to get into my<br />
business.</p>

<p><br />
I get frustrated with my (lack of) sex life when all I really want is someone<br />
to hold and cuddle and pour out all these emotions that are meant for the one<br />
you love.</p>

<p><br />
I wonder if Im really qualified to do my job. Do i have what it takes to make<br />
it in this world? (No thoughts of suicide here so put the phone down ;> )</p>

<p><br />
I regret having taken drugs in the past and yet I dont regret being able to<br />
tell my kids someday that, while I dont think they should, Im powerless to<br />
stop it unless I can institute in them a greater respect for themselves. Dont<br />
worry I wasnt a crack addict or anything. i smoked pot and whatnot. The part<br />
I regret is the fact that I did something to damage my most valuable assett -<br />
my mind. Try reconciling all of that with the fact that I think all drugs<br />
should be legal since its not the governments (especially a government that<br />
I dont trust as far as I can throw it) job to govern my life when Im not<br />
hurting anyone but myself.</p>

<p><br />
I want to make music and listen to music and feel music because its the<br />
soundtrack of my life.</p>

<p><br />
I want to read and I want to be able to stop time just so that I can have more<br />
time to read.</p>

<p><br />
I want the world to stop noticing me and yet pay more attention to me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All in all, I just think entirely too damn much. My sarchasm isnt so much<br />
because Im cynical, as it is that I want others to laugh and be able to<br />
forget about the world around them and just enjoy life. Dont worry about the<br />
things you cant change, they tell me.</p>

<p><br />
Screw you, I tell them. Im human. Its called compassion.</p>

<p><br />
Happy birthday and I hope you have a famous one. I hope your friends take you<br />
to the moon so you can see the world without the dirty details that so often<br />
drag us down. </p>
