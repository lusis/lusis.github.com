<p>So yesterday was my birthday.</p>


<p>Michelle got me an awesome t-shirt from <a href="http://www.neighborhoodies.com/catalog/">Neighborhoodies.com</a>.</p>

<p>I'll have pictures shortly but here's the gist:</p>

<p>We were watching Battlestar Galactica one night and getting annoyed over how Number 6 says the word "Gaius" and her random ramblings about religion. One of us (me allthough Michelle thinks she came up with it ;>) made the following comment:</p>

<p>"Ann Coulter is a Cylon"</p>

<p>It was a priceless moment that only a handful of people will probably get. We mentioned it to <a href="http://navratils.org">Joe</a> last night when he called to wish me a happy birthday and he simply said "Wow. That is so true on so many levels".</p>

<p>So without further wait, I introduce my very own meme:</p>

<p>"Ann Coulter is a Cylon"</p>

<p>And if you're curious, I turned 31 yesterday.</p>

<p>Well it seems I have a twin!</p>


<p>My buddy David at the office, sent me this handy link and picture from the Beeb (bbc.co.uk). Not sure how long it'll be up on the website so I've taken a screenshot</p>

<p><img src="/static/twin.jpg"></p>

<p>Funny eh?</p>

<p>Been a while hasn't it?</p>


<p>Things have been hectic around the lusis household lately. Here they are in no uncertain order:</p>

<p>1) John gets a new job. It's a financial company about 2 miles down the road from my apartment.</p>

<p>2) Because of new job, John and Michelle resume househunting.</p>

<p>3) John and Michelle find the perfect home about 3 miles from the apartment. Still a long drive for Michelle but John can pick up and respond to emergencies surrounding kids (future kids that is!) in no time.</p>

<p>4) John and Michelle go under contract on perfect home.</p>

<p>5) John and Michelle will close on said home this Thursday and move in on Saturday!</p>

<p><br />
Things are going splendid in case you hadn't noticed. I'm going to be sending out an email to all my friends over tomorrow about the moving party ;) Free beer and pizza if you help move boxes. We have a moving truck coming to haul the big stuff (have you seen Michelle's desk or my couch?) but to keep things low-cost, we need people to help carry boxes up to the truck and then place them in the prearranged spot in the garage at the new house. Beer, soda and pizza will be served afterwards while the UofM/Ohio State game is broadcast in our new living room!</p>

<p>To those of you I haven't been able to keep in touch with, I apologize greatly. Things have been a whirlwind and won't slow down again till after the first of the year. We move in on Saturday and then the following Tuesday, we head out to Michigan for Thanksgiving. We'll have two whole days to enjoy our new home =P</p>

<p>Wish us luck and come help move boxes ;)</p>

<span class="title">War Cribbage</span>

<p>Michelle and I just finished a rousing game of "War Cribbage"<br />
</p>


<p>It&#8217;s fun too! Basically it started out one night when I whupped up on Michelle after dinner. I think it was my first double skunk. We started messing around with the cards and playing cribbage in the same style as war.</p>

<p>Tonight we refined the game to it's ultimate version - A DRINKING GAME!</p>

<p>Here's how it works. Each person needs a deck. For Christmas, along with my new Cribbage Board, I got a NICE twin pack of <a href="http://www.kem.com" title="Best Cards - EVER">Kem&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>You reset your pegs to start. Each person takes a deck and you start. It's not as fast paced as war but it's just as fun.</p>

<p>- Take turns flipping cards - War Style.<br />
- Any points scored during play (15s, runs, pairs), forces the looser to drink while the winner counts out the number of points.<br />
e.g. Michelle plays 6, I play 7, she plays an 8. I now have to drink while she counts to 3. She doesn&#8217;t want to count TOO slow because if I lay down a 5, it&#8217;s going to be the longest 4 seconds she's ever known ;)<br />
- 31 only counts for a point and only a quick drink is required. That also gives you a point on the board.<br />
- A bust ( going over 31 ) is also a point. As before, looser only has to take a quick swig on a single point.<br />
- After each hand (31 points or bust), the cards are moved off to your own side in case you need to recycle.<br />
- Nobs are a bit unique. It works this way:<br />
  Nobs are only awarded when a jack is played that matches the suit of the previously played card. Since each person has their own desk, It&#8217;s POSSIBLE to have each person after the first get nobs (A - Ace of clubs, B- Jack of clubs, C - Jack of clubs, D - Jack of clubs &lt;and 31 for 2 more points&gt;)<br />
- The game is over when one person gets 30 points ( on my board - an up/down not a race track style - that&#8217;s the top of the lane. )</p>

<p>If you have any questions, email me and I&#8217;ll be glad to explain the rules a bit better. If you come up with any variations or other similar games (war euchre for instance), I&#8217;ll be glad to post them.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<span class="title">That's John "Mr. CCNA" Vincent to you!</span>

<p>Well I passed the CCNA.</p>


<p>Let me just tell you that the test is NOT easy. There is ALOT of stuff to know. It helps that I've been "doing" for the past 5+ years but it doesn't make it any easier.</p>

<p>I don't always remember commands off the top of my head and I have to occasionally look some things up.</p>

<p>Having said that, here are my tips for the CCNA.</p>

<p>1) Know subnetting like the back of your hand. I spent time to make sure I UNDERSTOOD it and then went back and made my own memorization charts. Know why the shortcuts work.</p>

<p>2) Routing is pretty important. I had more routing than switching questions.</p>

<p>3) Know subnetting.</p>

<p>4) Know IOS. The labs are not that easy. You have some access to "sh?" and "?" commands but you the labs are pretty involved. You don't want to waste time typing "encap?" "encapsulation ?" "encapsulation frame-relay ?" and on and on. The tab key DOES not work. Shortcuts such as "sh int e 0" are valid though. You aren't penalized for spelling mistakes either. I think the way the labs work are by comparing the configs left after you get done with one that is correct. </p>

<p>5) Know subnetting.</p>

<p>That's all I remember. Honestly. When I took my Microsoft tests, they weren't this hard (although I understand that they've gotten more real world and less regugitation). Even if you pass with a low score (hard to get since passing is 849/1000), you'll feel like you earned it. If you KNOW there are some areas that you feel like you performed not so well on, take a week off and then go back and read them after you pass the test. That is, if you feel like the CCNA is more than just a path to a higher paycheck. For me, it was a way to show employers that I know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, since I've been a network administrator for several years now, I just purchased the self-study guide for the 640-607 and the flash card kit. I'd also suggest getting a <a href="http://safari.informit.com" title="I love Safari">Safari Account</a>. Might I suggest you check out "Cisco® CCNA® Exam #640-607 Certification Guide" and print the "Foundation Summary" for each chapter. You can keep these around for the rest of your career as a quick ref. Also print out the Chapter 12 scenarios and black out the answers. Sit down and do them and then compare with the correct answers. These were probably the greatest help to me as it's a set of three scenarios that covers everything in a real world style example.</p>

<p>Good luck to anyone else taking it. If I get the job I've been working on, I plan on taking the <a href="http://www.extremenetworks.com/education/cert/ExtremeNetworksAssociate.asp" title="Extreme Networks">ENE</a> in several months. since they use Extreme stuff in-house.</p>

<p>Okay so a few people know I like to play a game called <a href="http://www.uo.com" title="UO">Ultima Online</a>. Well I'm not going to go into too many details but check out the above link. If you play the game, you'll understand how funny it is (And you've probably read it already). If you play some other game, you'll still understand. If you don't play any game, just laugh at North Korea!</p>

<p>I remembered seeing a link to these guys on <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org" title="there is no k5 cabal">k5</a> and decided to go back and do some research. I signed up an account this morning. It's going to cost me but two of the sites I host have agreed to split the bill with me (based on usage). I figure I'll be okay. It's just one of the costs of doing business as it were.</p>

<p>Well it seems like my site might just be shutting down soon.</p>


<p>It seems that my company will probably be shutting down in a week or so. This means I'll have to move hosting offsite somewhere inexpensive. Some people might say that I should not factor in hosting but I need a reliable email address and a place to host my resume as well as some other things (projects I'm working on that can relate to my resume). </p>

<p>Having said that, I don't know when the line will go dead but I'm working on part of that tonight (in addition to trolling monster.com!)</p>

<p>If I'm hosting a website for you, I can make a nice backup of everything you have and burn it to a cd (assuming you don't have everything backed up on your own side!).</p>

<p>And also, here's the tagline. If you know of any good companies in Atlanta or even Michigan and points in between looking for a high quality systems and network administrator, I'm available. I'll put my resume up shortly after I've updated it. I've been with this company for five years now and seeing as we did QA work, I got to play with ALOT of cool stuff. I've developed alot of neat stuff internally and handled an entire infrastucture move from one location to another by myself (and at one point sleeping under my yet-as-unfinished cubicle waiting on Qwest so things would be running by the time people came in).</p>

<p>I put alot into any company I work for and only expect that the company honors that work and respects me for it.</p>

<p>I'll keep the world updated! Or at least the world that reads my website ;)</p>

<p>I had the ring for 3 weeks prior. I WANTED to give it to her the night we found out we were pre-approved for our homeloan but I hadn't spoken with her parents at the time. They came down over Valentine's Day weekend along with her brother and his fiancee. We went to the RedWings game and the outlets and what not.</p>

<p>But back to the ring! (My precious as Michelle calls it. Scary!)</p>

<p>I had been planning on going out on a date this week. Friday and the rest of the weekend was out because she had a class all day each day. That left Thursday (farthest day out). We got dressed to go out to eat but we stopped across the street at Vickery Creek to take a walk. There's a nice set of cliffs there that alot of folks like to climb down. I took a couple of pictures of the cliff (knowing full well she would want a memory of it as would I).</p>

<p>Then I got her over by the cliffs to take a picture. She wanted to take one of me too. So I went over to the edge and waited. I put my hands in my pocket and felt the box. Something came over me and I pulled it out and opened it while she had the viewfinder up. She let the camera down and asked me what that was as I walked closer to her with the box open. I asked. She said yes.</p>

<p>After we got calmed down and sat down on the rocks, she said "Are you for real?". Heh.</p>

<p>Anyways, I've uploaded some pictures to the gallery. You can get to them <a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/album23">here</a>. YAH!</p>

<p>I get alot of spam. I mean alot. But sometimes I get a spam that makes me wonder WHAT in the hell someone was thinking?</p>


<p>This came to me via K5. When I say via K5, i mean some stupid bot scoured kuro5hin and snagged my email address.</p>

<p>This is why I have my own domain. I can use a different email for whatever the occasion.</p>

<p>Today's occasion is leeches. Or at least that's what some kind soul in Russia wants me to read about:</p>

<p>I've taken a bit of care with the people cc'd on this email. I masked all but the funny addresses. What I mean by funny is email addresses that were created SPECIFICALLY to avoid spam. I'm guessing it did the job because the attempted to mail the false addresses anyway.</p>

<p>I will give poor Valery credit, it's the most targetted bit of junk mail I've ever gotten. I VAGUELY remember participating in such a discussion on K5 at some point allthough my endless searching has turned up no such details.</p>

<span class="title">No vote for John</span>

<p>Well I won't be able to vote next week.</p>


<p>It seems a dopped ball  with the transfer of my voter registration information from Cobb to Fulton county is to blame. When I went to vote in the 2000 elections, I was told that I wasn't registered in Fulton County. They pointed me to the proper precint in Cobb County and said that they would transfer my information when I filled out a form there.</p>

<p>So I go to Cobb County and fill out my forms and vote. I didn't leave the poll until 7:30 and the polls closed at 7! It was a busy time.</p>

<p><br />
I went on the Secretary of State's website to find my polling station and it turns out I'm not listed. i checked Cobb County and nothing there. I call Fulton but the computers are down. I call Cobb and they tell me I was dropped from the rolls in June of 2001. I call Fulton back and explain all that to them. They tell me nothing can be done but the ball was dropped somewhere on the part of the two counties. I'm depressed but I make one last stab and call the Sec. of State's office directly.</p>

<p>After being transferred around 2 or three times, I finally get to the ""guru"" of voter registration. She basically tells me that if I had gotten to them a week earlier they might have been able to do something but I was out of luck now. Basically the two step transfer of registration only made it to step one..being dropped from Cobb County.</p>

<p>I'm really bummed by this. Michelle jokingly asked me if I wanted her to vote for me. Obviously I would never ask her to do that. I can only hope that the people I discuss politics with have come to think about the long-term effects of the people they choose to represent them.</p>

<p>Good luck to all the candidates running. While I probably wouldn't have voted for the majority of you, I still thank you for putting your lives up on the block in an effort to effect change in this country and state (however misguided I might think it to be).</p>

<p>To those of you voting, remember to vote in accordance with how you feel. You don't HAVE to choose one of the two major parties. Even if you vote Green or Libertarian or Independant, you're showing everyone else that being strangled by a two-party system that doesn't want the competition from fresh ideas presented by those parties that you won't be silenced.</p>

<p>We celebrated Mother's Day early this year.</p>


<p>Since Michelle and I are going to be in Michigan for Mother's Day, we celebrated multiple occasions on one day. Mom's Day, My cousin's son's birthday and Cinco De Mayo.</p>

<p>One the way north, I bought a new camera bag and a 128MB Compact flash card. I can get 300+ high res pictures on this thing. I had a blast with it.</p>

<p>You can see the pictures <a href="http://www.lusis.org/modules.php?set_albumName=album12&op=modload&name=gallery&file=index&include=view_album.php"> here</a></p>

<p>I got a REALLY good deal on a Polaroid PDC 1300 at K-Mart's going-out-of-business sale.</p>


<p>It only cost me $86. </p>

<p>I know the battery life sucks but I don't really care. It does what I need it to do. I bought a SanDisk usb compact flash reader and it works WONDERFULLY.<br />
I've added a few pics to the gallery that you can check out.</p>

<span class="title">Happy New Year</span>

<p>Another year is upon us,</p>


<p>and I don't feel any different.</p>

<p>I went out to a cool new bar last night for a while. It's called Mazzy's. They have NICE 9 ft pool tables and serve food too. Pretty keen. </p>

<p>I met up with Ned there about 9:30 and we shot pool for about an hour or so while he updated me on all the random shit going on in his life. His divorce. His 2 yr. old daughter.</p>

<p>We left to go to Ben's party around 11ish. There were about 20 people there and we had a good old time. Ben had his mp3 server hooked up to his tv and a nifty little plugin going so all the people could sit and stare ;)</p>

<p>We watched the ball AND the peach drop on split screen. As usual the peach got there first. Champagne was passed around to all and I would gather about 8 or so bottles were finished off. </p>

<p>I didn't drink much myself because I didn't feel like getting wasted as bad as last year. I was more interested in catching up with some people (like Ben) I hadn't talked to in  a few years. </p>

<p>Got home about 2ish and called Michelle up at Almont. We talked for about 45 minutes and I proceded to fall asleep on the couch until the dog decided to wake me up. Guess I drank a bit more than I thought eh?</p>

<p>Happy New Year to all of you and good luck to those of you in Europe switching to the Euro. Maybe it won't be as big a clusterf*ck as everyone thinks it will be ;)</p>

<span class="title">About me.</span>

<p>I figured I should put up something about myself to those who happen by my site.</p>


<p>Well here's the skinny.</p>

<p>My name's John. I'm 27 and live north of the city of Atlanta, GA. I'm your typical geek without the pocket protector and lack of social skills.</p>

<p>I have a dog. Her name is <a href="honey.jpg">Honey</a>. She's 6 years old and I picked her up the Atlanta Humane Society last year. </p>

<p>I'm dating a wonderful woman named Michelle. She lives in Michigan but will be moving down here next year. After all my debacles with online dating shit, I met someone on a Yahoo! group for one of my favorite authors.</p>

<p>I work for a company in Atlanta that does software quality assurance. I don't actually do any of the assurance myself. I just manage the network. I love it, too.</p>

<p>I drive a 2001 Ford Focus. I have an apartment that overlooks the Chattahoochee River. I own three computers and have parts for various other ones in random locations.</p>

<p>I run linux exclusivly and have Windows on a laptop for VPN stuff when I work from home. I also use it to play CivIII when I can.</p>

<p>I have a dvd player, digital cable (internet and tv), surround sound system and a queen sized bed.</p>

<p>In the closet I have a set of turntables and a pair of blue suede shoes.</p>

<p>I drink Guiness, Bass, Harp and Hoegarden with a lemon. (not all at once..at least not in the same glass ;>)</p>

<p>I drink white wines and eat Frosted Mini Wheats for breakfast. (again not at the same time).</p>

<p>I listen to bands like The Deftones, Incubus, Korn, and Cold. I love Courtney Love and Drew Barrymore.(allthough not together...okay well maybe together)</p>

<p>I remember when you could have your uncle or someone bring a gun to school for show and tell. I also remember getting paddled in school.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone is responsible for his own actions and that it is your DUTY to question the government at all times lest we loose our rights.</p>

<p>I am a strict constitutionalist and a libertarian. I believe that Social Security is a Ponzi scam and that the Lottery is a tax on the stupid.</p>

<p>I think all drugs should be legal if only to weed out the weak people. I've used drugs in my past and I'm just fine now and don't do them anymore.</p>

<p>Seems like this turned into more of a screed than anything but I think that about sums it up.</p>

<span class="title">My brain hurts......</span>

<p>and I'm going home.</p>


<p>Don't you just HATE those days when you think too much? I sure as hell do.</p>

<p>I walked into the door today and found out our VPN to one of our clients was down. In the process of walking into the server room to check the switch (a cheap ass linksys - nothing fancy for this particular setup was needed), I get sidetracked with another customer project. Seems our load tests keep failing and it might be a config issue on one of the 2000 servers (customer provided license so kiss my ass Microsoft). </p>

<p>In the process of getting THAT fixed, my boss mentions that So-and-So working on Project A (the one that hit me as I came in the door) was having problems. I inform said boss that I was working on that when I got sidetracked by Project B. I was informed that Project A is more important than Project B at this particular moment. I then procede to debug Project A until it's running again. </p>

<p>Turns out a port on the switch went bad for Project A. Turns out some Active Directory shit was fubar'd on Project B.</p>

<p>I sit down at my desk and it's already 12:00. </p>

<p>I decided to take the rest of the day to research some system admin stuff that I've been putting off. Software audit tools and the like. I spent the rest of the day reading Technet until just now when I patched our Office 2000 Standard SR-1 install with all the new patches.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to change out backup tapes and i'm going the hell home. If you're reading this from YOUR desk, I suggest you do the same.</p>

<p>At least I got all my christmas shopping done.</p>

<span class="title">Michigan</span>

<p>Well I got back from Michigan last night and boy do I have tales to tell!!!</p>


<p>Actually nothing so exciting except my a few troubles at the airport. Here's the scoop.</p>

<p>I got to the Marta station at 2:00. I got on the train and settled in for the 40 minute ride to the airport. I'm feeling all cool and stuff, wearing a neat new black combo outfit I bought for the trip (since I knew it would be cold, I bought a few long sleeved shirts). hell, even my underwear were black!</p>

<p><br />
The line at the Airtran counter was nice and short. I get up to the counter and answer all the questions. As I'm closing up my bag, the man at the counter informs me that my license is expired.</p>

<p><br />
runthatbymeonemoretime?</p>

<p><br />
It turns out when I reactivated my license at the begining of the year, they didn't renew it at the same time. It expired on my birthday. I could feel my stomach hit my knees. He told me that he would have let me go sign in but with all the strictness and the fact that people (poorly paid I might add) with guns would be checking it a second time as I went through the metal detectors to the gates, it would be stupid.</p>

<p><br />
I kindly asked him what time the next flight was while I ran down my options in my head.</p>

<p><br />
My passport was at home. It should still be valid from last summer (I think they're good for 3 years). I'll get a cab home and try and get back in time. I run out to the cab stand and explain to the manager my situation. He called a cabbie over and told me they could get me up to Northridge and back for $100. I swallowed hard and said ok. Mind you I've paid the cab fair to the airport from home before and one way was about 60 bucks at the time. I figured I was getting off easy. We get in the cab and take off. As we pull out of the airport, the cabbie says that he can take me somewhere to get a license and would do it for 50 bucks.</p>

<p><br />
The next words out of my mouth were "Is it legal?". I had visions of getting stranded in College Park at some low-rent apartment complex with my laptop bag in hand and a gun to my head. He said there was a license station at a Kroger nearby. I told him to do it and off we went.</p>

<p><br />
I was back at the airport in 30 minutes. Considering there was a chance that we wouldn't make it back in time if we had gone all the way north, I felt lucky. I pulled 50 bucks out of the ATM at the Kroger and paid him in cash with no meter.</p>

<p><br />
I went back to the Airtran line which oddly enough was now wrapped around the terminal.<br />
an hour later I was on my way to the gate. I plugged in my headphones when I got on the plane and slept.</p>

<p><br />
We landed in Flint and Michelle met me outside the security checkpoint. We stepped outside and my jewels jumped up in my stomach. Cold as hell.</p>

<p><br />
We had venison keebabs and various other things for dinner. Her mom, dad , brother and brother's girlfriend were really cool.</p>

<p><br />
Her dad(Mike) is a general purpose lawyer and he mom(Virginia) is a teacher.</p>

<p><br />
Jon(her brother) is back in school to be a lawyer after getting a degree in Archaeology. Jamie (girlfriend) is a nurse.</p>

<p><br />
The next morning we went to a local Saginaw joint called Tony's. It's like waffle house with more grease.</p>

<p><br />
Let me inform you of my ONE gripe with the north (other than the curse of god known as the Michigan D.O.T). Sweet tea does not exist. I thought about (and bitched about) this the entire weekend. Who in the hell would drink tea WITHOUT sugar unless they were dieting?</p>

<p><br />
They kept telling me to just add sugar but I explained to them that sugar doesn't dissolve properly in cold water. It has to be added to a fresh brew.</p>

<p><br />
God bless 'em the poor bastards ;)</p>

<p><br />
Friday morning Michelle and I drove back to Allegan, where she lives. It's a small town and freaking beautiful to boot.</p>

<p>We got up Saturday morning and went for breakfast at the single most pink diner I've ever seen. Everything was painted pink. We decided to walk around town and do some shopping for some things to bring everyone back home. I needed to stop by an ATM first though.</p>

<p><br />
........</p>

<p><br />
Uhhhh where the hell is my Visa/ATM card? I emptied my wallet right there and couldn't find it. We went back to her house and a dug through my luggage and laptop case. No luck. Best guess is that I left it IN the ATM machine at Kroger when i got money out for Adam the cabbie. I called and canceled it and sulked. Jon and Jamie had arrived while we were at lunch. We sat around and watched football (Michigan v. West Michigan/Notre Dame vs. Michigan State) all afternoon. My best guess is that this is a religious event. I actually enjoyed it.</p>

<p><br />
After all the games, we went down to the party store (no, not hats and whistles..a liquor store) and stocked up on some things. We went back to Michelle's and sat on the porch drinking and talking. A good time was had by all.</p>

<p><br />
(Side note: I'm still shocked that as we stopped at a 7-11, I was able to look behind the counter and see a big bottle of Captain Morgan's rum. Evidently, all the convienence stores there have liquor licenses or the restrictions are alot less harsh on selling liquor)</p>

<p><br />
Jon and Jamie stayed the night and left the next morning. Since it was raining all day, Michelle and I cuddled up on the futon and watched Quantum Leap re-runs on scifi (god what geeks we are). It cleared up by the time the final episode ran so we went for a walk down to the store and took a loop around through the graveyard in town. This thing was AMAZING. I started feeling a little sick so we headed back home. It turned out to be a overnight bug (possibly caused by the drastic change in weather?) and I was feeling good by next morning. We slept until noon and then I packed up. We went to get some lunch and stopped by an orchard on the way out of town to get some fruit for the road. Next time I come up i'm going to use my well guarded Visa card to by some stuff for the family and bring back. Of special note is the fresh apple cider and michigan honey (flower and sweet varieties no less!).</p>

<p><br />
Things were kind of quiet on the drive to Flint (2:45 hours from Allegan). We sat at the airport and read through Maxim together while we waited for my flight to be called. When it was, we walked to the gate together and I kissed her goodbye.</p>

<p><br />
It sucked. I didn't want to leave but I needed to get back to work. (I kept hoping a sudden snowstorm would hit and I would get stuck for a few more days ;> )</p>

<p><br />
The flight home was boring. The train ride home was boring. The drive home was boring.</p>

<p><br />
i'm already planning my next trip up in December ;) </p>
