<span class="title">About me.</span>

<p>I figured I should put up something about myself to those who happen by my site.</p>


<p>Well here's the skinny.</p>

<p>My name's John. I'm 27 and live north of the city of Atlanta, GA. I'm your typical geek without the pocket protector and lack of social skills.</p>

<p>I have a dog. Her name is <a href="honey.jpg">Honey</a>. She's 6 years old and I picked her up the Atlanta Humane Society last year. </p>

<p>I'm dating a wonderful woman named Michelle. She lives in Michigan but will be moving down here next year. After all my debacles with online dating shit, I met someone on a Yahoo! group for one of my favorite authors.</p>

<p>I work for a company in Atlanta that does software quality assurance. I don't actually do any of the assurance myself. I just manage the network. I love it, too.</p>

<p>I drive a 2001 Ford Focus. I have an apartment that overlooks the Chattahoochee River. I own three computers and have parts for various other ones in random locations.</p>

<p>I run linux exclusivly and have Windows on a laptop for VPN stuff when I work from home. I also use it to play CivIII when I can.</p>

<p>I have a dvd player, digital cable (internet and tv), surround sound system and a queen sized bed.</p>

<p>In the closet I have a set of turntables and a pair of blue suede shoes.</p>

<p>I drink Guiness, Bass, Harp and Hoegarden with a lemon. (not all at once..at least not in the same glass ;>)</p>

<p>I drink white wines and eat Frosted Mini Wheats for breakfast. (again not at the same time).</p>

<p>I listen to bands like The Deftones, Incubus, Korn, and Cold. I love Courtney Love and Drew Barrymore.(allthough not together...okay well maybe together)</p>

<p>I remember when you could have your uncle or someone bring a gun to school for show and tell. I also remember getting paddled in school.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone is responsible for his own actions and that it is your DUTY to question the government at all times lest we loose our rights.</p>

<p>I am a strict constitutionalist and a libertarian. I believe that Social Security is a Ponzi scam and that the Lottery is a tax on the stupid.</p>

<p>I think all drugs should be legal if only to weed out the weak people. I've used drugs in my past and I'm just fine now and don't do them anymore.</p>

<p>Seems like this turned into more of a screed than anything but I think that about sums it up.</p>

<span class="title">My brain hurts......</span>

<p>and I'm going home.</p>


<p>Don't you just HATE those days when you think too much? I sure as hell do.</p>

<p>I walked into the door today and found out our VPN to one of our clients was down. In the process of walking into the server room to check the switch (a cheap ass linksys - nothing fancy for this particular setup was needed), I get sidetracked with another customer project. Seems our load tests keep failing and it might be a config issue on one of the 2000 servers (customer provided license so kiss my ass Microsoft). </p>

<p>In the process of getting THAT fixed, my boss mentions that So-and-So working on Project A (the one that hit me as I came in the door) was having problems. I inform said boss that I was working on that when I got sidetracked by Project B. I was informed that Project A is more important than Project B at this particular moment. I then procede to debug Project A until it's running again. </p>

<p>Turns out a port on the switch went bad for Project A. Turns out some Active Directory shit was fubar'd on Project B.</p>

<p>I sit down at my desk and it's already 12:00. </p>

<p>I decided to take the rest of the day to research some system admin stuff that I've been putting off. Software audit tools and the like. I spent the rest of the day reading Technet until just now when I patched our Office 2000 Standard SR-1 install with all the new patches.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to change out backup tapes and i'm going the hell home. If you're reading this from YOUR desk, I suggest you do the same.</p>

<p>At least I got all my christmas shopping done.</p>

<p>Too bad I love my girlfriend too much to get with Drew ;)</p>

<span class="title">Grrrrrr</span>

<p>Okay I'm just gonna start blocking all the asian countries.</p>


<p>I'm tempted to just block all .cn , .kr , .jp and anything else that I can think of. The only thing I've ever gotten emailed from those domains is spam. Nothing else. If anyone who get's mail on this server has any objections, let me know by midnight tonight. Otherwise, monday morning I'm going to block them with ipchains or something more at the router level.</p>

<p>It's my mailserver anyway ;)</p>
