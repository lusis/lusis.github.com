<span class="title">Dating</span>

<p>[from the lusis.org archives]</p>


<p>Im sitting in my office writing this with the air conditioning off as a form of catharsis. Its hot and Im pissy. Any fucking questions?</p>

<p><br />
On with the fun.</p>

<p><br />
I started dating again recently. It was a fairly intentional choice. For the past few years I havent dated, not since Liz. I consider relationships to be something serious and since I didnt seem to have the time to invest in one.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now if you can believe that total bullshit I just fed you then we can go on with this like adults. I HAVENT dated in the sense of the word since Liz but Ive gone out on occasion. My latest forays were an intentional effort on my part to start going out with women again. I signed up for matchmaker at the behest of afriend who had success there. The questionaires were well thought out and provided for a wonderful overview of not only yourself but anyone you might be interested in. Having submitted a profile, I filled out the numerous essay questions. These essay questions are basically the same thing you got in a standardized school test only having more bearing on your life than explaining why a train travelling from point A to point B at a rate of 95 miles an hour would eventually crash and cause despair to hundreds of families. On these pages of answers you would entice and ensnare a possible dinner partner whos entire opinion of you would be formed around, not only whether or not you would own X rated movies or had considered a homosexual experience, but also what you considered "SEXY", who you would have lunch with if you could have lunch with one person and whatever else you felt like they didnt ask you. I had no made myself open to one and all who might wonder what I was all about.</p>

<p><br />
I waited anxiously for my picture to be approved and get posted. I decided to check my matches and see what my options were. Lets see....65 miles from my location maximum. only seeking women thank you very much. Lets just see the ones with pictures for now. No one under 18 and over 30. Should be easy enough. SUBMIT! The page refreshed and I was presented with a list of possible matches based on how they answered the same questions I did. Some had essay answers and some did not. Lets click this one here.</p>

<p><br />
..................</p>

<p>Ahh now she looks normal. Lets see we seem to match 56%. Wonderful! Lets find what shes about shall we? Hrmmm. Interesting. Okay so multiple choice questions dont say much. I wonder what she said in her essay questions.</p>

<p>...............</p>

<p><br />
Q. What are you looking for in a mate?</p>

<p>A. I WOULD LIKE A MAN WHO IS ATTRACTIVE AND WELL MANNERED AND CUTE AND TALL AND FISCALLY SECURE AND CAN TREAT ME LIKE THE PRINCESS I AM!</p>

<p><br />
Where the fuck is my gun? Why did I drag myself into this? I hate people WHO THINK TYPING LIKE THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF COMMUNICATION!!!!!! LOL LOL LOL</p>

<p><br />
I come from the old days of bbs, muds and even the more recent IRC where typing in caps is to imply YELLING! Get it? I couldnt get past the first damn essay question. In the words of the great and oft late ImANewbie, "This doth not bode well."</p>

<p><br />
I proceded to check other matches to see what was up. Somethings got better and somethings got worse. I learned the quick and easy way to decide whether or not to finish a profile. I checked the answers to two multiple choice questions and the first essay question (which was always about what you looked for in a mate). The two questions I checked first are these:</p>

<p><br />
Q: What is your annual income?</p>

<p>Less than $12k</p>

<p>$12k - $15k</p>

<p>$15k - $25k</p>

<p>$25k - $35k</p>

<p>$35k - $50k</p>

<p>$50k - $75k</p>

<p>$75k - $100k</p>

<p>$100k - $150k</p>

<p>$150k - $200k</p>

<p>$200k - $250k</p>

<p>Over $250k</p>

<p>None of your damn business!</p>

<p>What, me work?</p>

<p><br />
Now if I ever saw "None of your damn business" that was one strike. If you are that insecure about what you do in life then I dont care for you. Next question:</p>

<p><br />
Q. How many X-rated movies do you OWN?</p>

<p>None, and I never will!</p>

<p>None, but I rent them</p>

<p>None, but Ill watch one with you</p>

<p>1 X-movie</p>

<p>2 - 5 X-movies</p>

<p>6 - 10 X-movies</p>

<p>11 - 25 X-movies</p>

<p>Over 25 X-movies</p>

<p>Im in some of them!</p>

<p><br />
"None and I never will" was another strike. "Im in some of them" is a sign that God does exist. Most common answer was c. "None, but Ill watch one with you"</p>

<p><br />
So and so forth to the essay question.<br />
The whole process wasnt a waste. I met several nice women. All of them intelligent (my primary desire) and willing to watch "Lukes freak party 101 with the big booty chicks in Miami" at least once. Yet in each case except for one, something would hinder a chance for a relationship to go anywhere. Im not Jewish so anything more than a casual relationship (these two words do not go together in my book. Friends dont fuck friends. If we arent having sex then we are friends. If we are, its a relationship). I dont have time to swing dance. While I have been over my last realtionship, you are actually still in yours and not ready to leave anytime soon. Sorry Im selfish. Its all me or nothing.</p>

<p><br />
In fairness to all of these fine ladies, this is part of what dating is all about. Finding out what the other person likes and doesnt like. Will it work or wont it work. Do we even have fun together. Is there any attraction to each other?</p>

<p><br />
I hate dating. I hate small talk. I hate bullshitting and talking about nothing that matters in the end. I cant stand it. I loathe it and that in itself is an understatement. By dating I mean this trial and error meet and greet. This is why I dont go to buckhead. I hate the auction block ass for sale attitude that its about. That and Im not a fratboy with a backwards cap and pecs the size of my dog so I go pretty much unnoticed.</p>

<p><br />
Say what you will but I think God has preordained certain people to marry and others to stay single. Then there are the people like me. We just write about it. </p>
