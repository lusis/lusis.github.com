<p> I just read that Douglas Adams died. Im at the point of tears and I cant even explain why.</p>

<p><br />
Why would someone feel for someone else that theyve never met and probably would have never met? What is it about someone famous/semi-famous that we create this strange relationship with them and the things they produce? I didnt care when Princess Di died. I didnt care when JFK Jr. died. Hell, I didnt care when Ernhardt died other than the fact that my family is a huge group of NASCAR fans but this one strikes somewhere deep down inside me. It hurts. And more than hurting it just plain sucks.</p>

<p><br />
I dont remember how I first came to read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. I just remember it being one of the most amazing stories I had ever read. Finally someone had written something that I REALLY liked. It made me laugh. It was a smart book. Most people would read it and not get it. But I got it. It shaped the types of books I still read to this day. It shaped my entire sense of humor. It was the first thing I can remember that had one of the greatest impacts on my life. I know you think Im crazy but I can attribute everything from my own personal writing style to my sense of humor to my outlook on life to H2G2.</p>

<p><br />
One of my favorite all time lines from any book, movie or song ever is from one of Douglas Adams books. Its about flying. Here it goes:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying.<br />
There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying.<br />
The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.<br />
Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it.<br />
The first part is easy.<br />
All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that its going to hurt.<br />
That is, its going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.<br />
Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.<br />
Clearly, its the second point, the missing, which presents the difficulties.<br />
One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. Its no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you wont. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when youre halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much its going to hurt if you fail to miss it.<br />
It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most peoples failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.<br />
If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.<br />
This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.<br />
Bob and float, float and bob.<br />
Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher.<br />
Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.<br />
They are most likely to say something along the lines of, "Good God, you cant possibly be flying!"<br />
It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.<br />
Waft higher and higher.<br />
Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly.<br />
Do not wave at anybody.<br />
When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve.<br />
You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway.<br />
You will also learn how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first attempt.<br />
There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the crucial moments. Few genuine hitch-hikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.<br />
-- "The Life, The Universe and Everything" - Chapter 9</p>

I find that to be the funniest thing I have ever read. All of his books are written with the same style. The silliness. The stupidity. The wit. I can remember cracking up when I realized that the trilogy series of H2G2 was actually 5 books long!</p>

<p><br />
Douglas Adams wrote some other amazing books as well. Dirk Gentleys Holistic Detective Agency and Long Dark Teatime of the Soul. Those two books are completely different than the H2G2 series but they are wonderful none the less.</p>

<p><br />
All in all, I cant say enough about the joys Ive had from reading Douglas Adams books. They mean so much to me and Im saddened to think another one will never be written.</p>

<p><br />
I think Ill get my pink towel and go outside. You never know what will happen.</p>
