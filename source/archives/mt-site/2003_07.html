<span class="title">John Gilmore is at it again</span>

<p><a title="'Suspected terrorist' removed from flight | Metafilter" href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/27098">John Gilmore is raising more hell</a></p>


<p>I&apos;ve been following <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/" title="yes he IS somewhat weird!">John Gilmore</a> for a while. Despite my desire wanting to smack him around for not knowing the difference between a democracy and a federal republic, I was really interested in <a href="http://freetotravel.org/" title="NO TICKET!">his case against the government</a> that requires a picture ID to fly nowadays. At one point, I printed out the entire brief and took it with me on a trip to Michigan hoping to get the Huffman family lawyer to look at it.</p>

<p>I got my email from <a href="http://www.politechbot.com" title="Geeks and Politics">Politech</a> over the weekend. Michelle and I both were a bit flabergasted when I finished reading her the story.</p>

<p>I think the whole thing is just stupid. I also think British Airways might want to retrain the flight crew on the stupidity of thinking that security screener would give a badge to a &quot;suspected terrorist&quot; to identify him.</p>

<p>John Gilmore is actually making a bigger statement with this. Were his civil rights violated? Not in the least.  The real key lies in what he says after discussing things with a BA rep:</p>

<p>&quot;<br />
I asked whether I would be permitted to fly if I wore other buttons,<br />
perhaps one saying &quot;Hooray for Tony Blair&quot;.  She said she thought that<br />
would be OK.<br />
&quot;</p>

<p>People like Sean Hannity, like to rail against opposing speech saying that it's unpatriotic to question authority in a time of war or that it crosses a line at some point. Of ocurse only the active political party can tell you what that line is but let's ignore that.</p>

<p>I also like this part:</p>

<p>&quot;<br />
I told her that it refers to all of us, everyone, being<br />
suspected of being terrorists, being searched without cause, being<br />
queued in lines and pens, forced to take our shoes off, to identify<br />
ourselves, to drink our own breast milk, to submit to indignities.<br />
Everyone is a suspected terrorist in today&apos;s America, including all<br />
the innocent people, and that's wrong.<br />
&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to political correctness, we aren&apos;t allowed to profile criminals because it's racism we are left with the above situation.</p>

<p>I&apos;d also like to point out some misconceptions that Mr. Gilmore has w.r.t. BA. I find some of this rather surprising since he allowed himself to be interview by <a href="http://www.reason.com" title='free minds and free markets">a magazine</a> that is named after something he seems to be missing.</p>

<p>As I&apos;ve said in the past, censorship and freedom of speech ONLY applies to the government in the Constitution. Even then there are some restrictions (of which are common sense restrictions). BA has every right to restrict Mr. Gilmore&apos;s political speech.  This is the other side of free speech - as it relates to individuals. You have freedom of speech but not freedom from consequences. As with the Dixie Chicks, Natalie was perfectly free to say that she was ashamed that the president was from her state but that might come with consequences. In her case, radio stations refused to play her music. That was the freedom of speech the radio stationed exercised. Some people even went off and had mass record burnings. I personally think that was more scary. It is also proof why our government is not a pure democracy and why it is so dangerous.</p>

<p>The second aspect is the guilt by association. Individuals are allowed to make determination as to who the choose to do business with or associate with. In the case of BA, Mr. Gilmore was causing a ruckus (in the minds of the BA team anyway) and thus they might (rightly so) expect the same from his partner. As we know the assumption was wrong in the end but that is a consequence of guilt by association. Look at it this way, if you are being mugged and there is a person who is with the mugger but does not actually do anything wrong, he is still party to the crime. If you were an employer, would you hire someone on the recommendation of an employee you found to be lazy and non-productive? Probably not. You could be wrong but the people we associate with are a direct reflection of who we are.</p>

<p>I think I've done enough ranting for now though. Feel free to comment and tell me I'm wrong. If you find any logical flaws in what I am saying, I would also love to hear it. Either way, I am free to disagree. Gotta love freedom of speech. Works both ways!<br />

<p><a title="" href="http://lusis.org/static/userContent.css" title="Block ads now!">My userContent.css for Mozilla based browsers</a></p>


<p>So I added a few entries to the file recently and wanted to update them.</p>

<p>First off is a nice little hack to block flash ads. It applies to all flash content though. Any site that has flash on it, will get a button in place of the flash that says "Click here to play flash". It comes in handy on Yahoo! and a few other sites that abuse flash as an advertising medium.</p>

<p>The other hacks are more entries to block specific adserver strings.</p>

<p>If anyone has directions on how to get this working with IE or opera, I'd be interested to see it. Both browsers allow you to use a custom stylesheet but I think some of the lines in the file are gecko specific.</p>

<p>As always, refer to my <a href="http://www.lusis.org/mt/lusis/archives/2003_03.html#000087" title="The original article mentioning how to install the file">original post on the matter</a></p>

<span class="title">Well it's official</span>

<p><a title="AOL Kills Netscape | Metafilter" href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/27002">AOL Kills Netscape | Metafilter</a></p>


<p>It seems that AOL has finally done what everyone THOUGHT they would do years ago..they&apos;ve killed netscape. All the nifty slashdot jokes about it being official are actually true now - Netscape is dead.</p>

<p>I've linked to the MeFi article on this because one can usually find good discussion there. Either way, there are articles and blog entries ALL over the web. <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com" title="CSS god">Eric Meyer</a> has his own inside take on the matter as well.</p>

<p>The gist of the matter is this. A product named Netscape no longer exists. The <strong>core</strong> of Netscape, known as Mozilla is still going strong. This is one of the joys of opensource. Some of the mozteam have formed the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Now with new marketing layouts!">Mozilla Foundation</a>, a non-profit group that will fund further Mozilla development partly with a 2 million dollar donation from AOL and other contributions from Sun and IBM (who have already hired a few core moz developers to work on the project.</p>

<p>What is interesting to note about the whole thing is that AOL <strong>JUST</strong> signed a deal with Microsoft to use Internet Explorer in the AOL product for the next seven years.</p>

<p>I&apos;m curious how this will play out considering that Microsoft also just announced that IE will no longer be provided as a standalone browser product. It will be forever more incorporated into Windows and new versions only available with a new operating system upgrade.</p>

<p>I have a few thoughts related to the future of web standards here. As someone who occassionally does a web page here and there, I'm bummed that I have to tolerate and support the broken IE6 png and css issues forever. You may ask why forever? Well I don't know of anyone who will upgrade an OS just to get a new browser. Of course a large percentage of the new browsers will be distributed with new computer purchases but how many independant developers are going to be able to afford the latest OS upgrade from Microsoft just to test out a website? Not many will spend. This is good news for web developers (allthough it could bite them in the ass). Develop for the standards compliant browsers on the market. Opera, Mozilla and Safari. I know there are more out there but they are mostly based on the core of either KHTML (in the case of Safari and Konq for KDE) or Gecko (in the case of Mozilla, Firebird, Galeon, Chimera, Epiphany et al). After that go back and see how it looks in IE6. You should also check IE55 (as broken as it is) for a little while longer.</p>

<p>You should be pretty safe if you do that. I'm curious to see what nasty little proprietary extensions MS will add to IE7+ though.</p>

<p>As for me, I have to do some family computer work this weekend and I plan on putting Mozilla on both machines and show them the pop-up blocking features. This is the kind of thing that will sway users to Mozilla and others over IE. </p>

<p>Why pay for a popup blocker when you can get one for free? Why pay for an OS upgrade to get a popup blocker when you can get one for free?</p>

<p>Comments are welcome and, yes, I'm still working on my new layout. Be sure and comment there as well.</p>

<p>Well I'm changing the layout. I picked up the <a href="http://www.zeldman.com" title="Check out Zeldman&apos;s homepage">"orange book"</a> and just finished reading it. I didn't do anything till I got all the way through it.</p>

<p>I'm still getting a grasp on the xhtml nibblets (such as using ampersand codes instead of the standard character) but it's working out well. I&apos;m also learning quite a bit new information.</p>

<p>My goal is to have the site <a href="#footer" title="W3C validation links">validate</a> properly as well as be <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="It really makes you think">accessible</a>.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re running <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla Web Browser">mozilla</a>, I would HIGHLY suggest you get the <a href="http://placenamehere.com/pnhtoolbar/" title="Developer&apos;s toolbar">PNH Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>Not only will it allow you to disable all styles on a website to verify how the site will look to a different screen format (i.e. one that doesn't support stylesheets or uses its own layout - such as a phone) or screen reader, but it allows you to outline block elements so that you don&apos;t have to do stupid stuff like draw borders around all your box elements to see which is which.</p>

<p>Email me with any questions and PLEASE feel free to post comments with tips and tricks of your own.</p>

<p>I found this wonderful tidbit via <a href="http://nataliesolent.blogspot.com/2003_07_06_nataliesolent_archive.html#105753212650608636" title="Natalie Solent">Natalie Solent's blog</a>.</p>

<p>It's an amazing story from a Kenyan woman about globalization and how free markets lead to higher standards of living. </p>

<p>The best quote was this:</p>

<p><i>I was introduced formally to freedom and free market by reading books on freedom. The insights it offered were crystal clear. Presenting to me questions I had never contemplated before, such as what the proper role of government is, and the idea that protection of life, liberty and property were the only functions that could be justified in the existence of governments.</i><br />
