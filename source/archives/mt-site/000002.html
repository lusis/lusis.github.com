<p>This article was reprinted on linux.com several years ago when Microsoft was being taken to court.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>MS vs DOJ: True Innovation</p>

<p>[from the lusis.org rants archive]</p>

<p>Im a geek. More specifically, Im a computer geek. I use Linux</p>

<p>and I like it. I advocate it whenever possible. The only reason I</p>

<p>say all this is to somehow qualify me for what I am about to</p>

<p>write. Anyone could write this and most already have, but I</p>

<p>want to offer my viewpoint. Of course Im talking about the</p>

<p>Microsoft anti-trust trial.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I dont like Microsoft for the most part. You see Im a network</p>

<p>administrator. I deal with all flavors of UNIX and all flavors of</p>

<p>Microsoft platforms. There are days, like the ones I had this</p>

<p>past week, in which I curse Bill Gates and his company with</p>

<p>every breath. I curse the fact that they have taken proven</p>

<p>standards and done just enough to make them non-standard.</p>

<p>I curse the fact that everything has to be so convoluted when</p>

<p>all I really would prefer to do is edit a configuration file and</p>

<p>restart a service. I want log files that I can "tail -f" and see</p>

<p>exactly what is happening. I want control over my servers.</p>

<p>Microsoft has taken that control away.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then I stop to clear my head and realize that, if not for</p>

<p>Microsoft, I probably would not be in the position I am today.</p>

<p>Of course we used Apple IIs when I was in grade school and I</p>

<p>learned BASIC on an Aquarius (anyone remember those?),</p>

<p>but that was about the extent of my computer knowledge until</p>

<p>I graduated from high school. I didnt have a PC at home until</p>

<p>after I graduated. When I did get back into computing it was</p>

<p>with DOS and a bit later, Windows 3.1. It all came naturally to</p>

<p>me. I think that the ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) helped a</p>

<p>bit. I decided to pursue my MCSE. I even passed Windows NT</p>

<p>3.51 Server and Workstation. But I discovered Linux and since</p>

<p>that day my knowledge has grown tenfold. No longer was</p>

<p>everything handed to me on a plate. I had to figure things out</p>

<p>on my own and it was A Good Thing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But it started with Microsoft. Whatever you think about</p>

<p>Microsofts business practices, you cant deny the many</p>

<p>positive things they have done for the world of personal</p>

<p>computers. Some would argue that we would have gotten</p>

<p>there eventually, but how long would it have taken? Would we</p>

<p>still be in an era of command-line operating systems (not that</p>

<p>there is anything wrong with that)? Would the landscape of</p>

<p>technology be where it is today if it were not for a company</p>

<p>like Microsoft forcing its way into the world? I dont think so.</p>

<p>You can thank Bill Gates for getting the PC into homes and</p>

<p>making it easy enough for the average Joe. Now you may say</p>

<p>"what about Steve Jobs and Apple?" I say that things would</p>

<p>be farther behind if the desktop market were controlled by</p>

<p>Apple. Dont get me wrong, I like Apple too, but at least with</p>

<p>Microsoft you get a command shell (no matter how useless it</p>

<p>is). Lets not turn this into a flame war on operating systems,</p>

<p>though. This is my opinion, however useless you may find it to</p>

<p>be.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Getting back to the matter at hand, what "good" has Microsoft</p>

<p>accomplished? Whenever I get frustrated and think that we</p>

<p>would all be better off without Windows, I think about a</p>

<p>commercial that Microsoft put out last year. Its with one about</p>

<p>Microsoft developers talking about making computers</p>

<p>accessible to the handicapped. At the end of the commercial</p>

<p>you see the developer grabbing his cane and finding his way</p>

<p>out the door. He is blind, you see. Innovation costs ... a lot.</p>

<p>Microsoft has the money to back it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Is Microsoft a monopoly? Definitely. Do they deserve to be</p>

<p>punished? Oh yes. Did Windows NT breed a generation of</p>

<p>worthless system administrators who can do nothing but</p>

<p>regurgitate information that would get them nowhere if the</p>

<p>problem fell outside what theyve learned? You betcha. Is Bill</p>

<p>Gates the anti-Christ? No. You and I both know this. Of</p>

<p>course he used his muscle and money to kill smaller</p>

<p>companies, absorb others and destroy anyone who got in his</p>

<p>way, but you cant deny that he is a smart businessman. He</p>

<p>knew what it would take to make computing a part of</p>

<p>everyday life.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I think we are now at the point where we can do without</p>

<p>Windows. The worlds technology sector has evolved to the</p>

<p>point that if Microsoft were to disappear, someone else could</p>

<p>easily step in and fill the market for a consumer operating</p>

<p>system. Linux, xBSD and others have already started</p>

<p>replacing the server market. With that we get a new</p>

<p>generation of system administrators and network</p>

<p>administrators who actually know what they are doing and can</p>

<p>do more than point and click. But as for the desktop market,</p>

<p>we will never get that. I wouldnt install a Linux machine for my</p>

<p>mother to use as her computer at home. Not yet anyway. She</p>

<p>doesnt want to know the internals. She wants to send e-mail,</p>

<p>browse the Web and write documents that she can share with</p>

<p>others. She wants one-touch scanning for her pictures.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What should the government do at this point? Fine Billy Boy</p>

<p>and his crew? It wouldnt matter if they did. Theyll recoup the</p>

<p>fine in less than a year. Force them to open up the source</p>

<p>code? I dont want the government to have that kind of control</p>

<p>over a company, Microsoft or otherwise. Our hallowed leaders</p>

<p>have already proven that they just dont get it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So what do they do then? I say they should break up the</p>

<p>company. Split up into two divisions: Operating Systems and</p>

<p>Applications. The judge has argued in his finding of facts that</p>

<p>Microsoft has hurt the consumer market. If you force them to</p>

<p>break up, we may see more innovation from the applications</p>

<p>group like never before. They would not be restricted to coding</p>

<p>for Windows only. We may see open file formats that people</p>

<p>can use. Think about how much better StarOffice and similar</p>

<p>projects would be if an applications branch could release file</p>

<p>specs openly without fear of angering the gods on high? This</p>

<p>would allow for more competition. If the applications branch</p>

<p>wants to make money, they will have to cater to all popular</p>

<p>operating systems, not just Windows and Macintosh. I would</p>

<p>buy a copy of Office for Linux, if it were available. I need</p>

<p>compatibility with the rest of the office when it comes to</p>

<p>document sharing, spreadsheet sharing and the like. I would</p>

<p>buy a copy of "Age of Empires: Age of Kings" for Linux if it</p>

<p>were available.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You may disagree with everything that Ive said here. You</p>

<p>may say that I am a secret Microsoft mole sent to cloud the</p>

<p>minds of the true believers. I say to you, go back and read the</p>

<p>Advocacy HOWTO. Each OS has its place. Windows had its</p>

<p>place and still does. Break Microsoft up and let them really</p>

<p>innovate. </p>
