<p>You've gotta love how unions want to get into the wallets of everyone.</p>

<p>I read about this website somewhere and decided to check it out. That's when I noticed the CWA logo at the bottom.</p>

<p>These guys have been trying to get at the tech community for years. There was a push during the boom orginally. Now it seems they are preying on the laid off tech staff in the U.S. and playing on xenophobia.</p>

<p>Let me make something clear. If someone wants to start a union, fine. It's your right as free individual to do so but I expect more from my fellow tech employees than that. We are all intelligent and hard working individuals who realize that what sets us apart from anyone else is our work. All the AFL-CIO and CWA wants is union dues. Why should someone who doesn't work as hard as you be rewarded the same as you are? If the CWA had its way, a network administrator wouldn't be able to make his own patch cable. That job would be reserved for a Cable Maker. Look at what unions did to Eastern Airlines. Spend your money making yourself more marketable and desireable to an employer, not lining the wallets of union reps. Your company will do better and so will you.</p>

<span class="title">checks and balances: Bush Administration reminder</span>

<p>Jose Padilla gets to see his lawyers!</p>


<p>Now before I go any further, let me say that i think the guy is scum. I think he is useless and that I hope he gets the full force of the law brought against him.</p>

<p>Some of you may not remember. I'm guessing the Bush Administration and the Ashcroft Regime was happy if that's the case.</p>

<p>An American citizen was being held illegally by the military. He was denied Due Process and all his rights were stripped.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that. </p>

<p>And American citizen. Just like you and just like me. Not someone in the States on a Visa. Nothing at all like that. Mind you he's a criminal with a gang record, but he is still a citizen and by the U.S. Constitution, entitled to certain rights as such.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was detained by the government for having SUSPECTED ties to Al Qaeda. They said he MIGHT have been involved in a plot to detonate a dirty bomb.</p>

<p>Let's cut through all the emotional rhetoric and get down to what this really is.</p>

<p>Despite his ties, if any, to Al Qaeda, this was a citizen of this country who was arrested for his thoughts.</p>

<p>Thoughtcrime.</p>

<p>The government claimed he was an "enemy combatant" and therefore his rights were out the window. </p>

<p>Jose Padilla didn't rise up and take arms against the U.S. He was arrested on a material witness warrant and secretly held in a government prison.</p>

<p>This vague "enemy combatant" crap has to go. He didn't DO anything. The government had to nothing but label him and he looses all his rights? I don't remember reading that part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>As bad as some people think it sounds, there are different rules for citizens and non-citizens. If you want the protection of the Constitution of the United States, only one thing is asked in return. That is to be a citizen of the United States. It says "We the people of the Untied States of America"  not "We the people of the world". If you are a citizen of this country, our government's job is to ensure the rights set forth in that document.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was granted that right by birth. Whether or not he deserves it is not up for the government to decide. I'm still researching but as far as I understand, the only way you can revoke your birth-right citizenship in the U.S., other than filing for it, is to physically go to war for a foreign government against the U.S. Most of the stuff I've found online involves denaturalizing immigrants.</p>

<p>Let me remind everyone yet again, I don't support this Padilla character IF he was indeed planning (not actually doing) these things but if I want my birthrights to stay secure, I have to stand up for his.</p>

<p>Let the government play fair ball the way they've had to for 200 years and convict him in a U.S. court.</p>

<span class="title">Commentary on Islam</span>

<p>Michelle and I were talking about this the other day.</p>


<p><a href="http://blogsofwar.blogspot.com/2002_11_24_blogsofwar_archive.html#85298621">A Religion of Peace vs. a "Religion of Peace"</a>.</p>

<p>I'm of the unresearched opinion that in general, Islam may hav inherent issues that don't allow for the peaceful coexistance of other religions. Notice I said "unresearched". I don't have the time to research with the holidays and work. Be assured that I will.</p>

<p>And yes i'm aware that the caliphats of olde did allow for christians and jews to live in Islam controlled territories. The exception was that they had to pay taxes and Muslims didn't. </p>

<p>I found the above line from <a href="http://nataliesolent.blogspot.com/">Natalie Solent's weblog</a>.</p>

<span class="title">Screw 'em.</span>

<p>Well it looks like the Afghanis are determined to kill themselves.</p>


<p>And I say, let 'em. Today a bomb blew up in a taxi in Kabul and later someone tried to assasinate Hamid Karzai.</p>

<p>I've now decided that the U.S. should just pull out all together. We (the U.S. Military) are providing bodyguards to Karzai. We're putting our armed forces on the line when the Middle East is bound and determined to destroy itself. <br />
Fine! If you backwards ass bastards want to kill each other, just do it.  Destroy every single bit of culture and history you have just to hold to some stupid, dated, vague and misguided  religious tenants. I don't care. While you're at it, take Benny Hinn, Jerry Fallwell and the Catholic priesthood with you.</p>

<p>Jim told me about a bumper sticker he saw the other day. It said "Lord, protect me from your followers."</p>

<p>When I was heavily involved with the church and youth ministries, one thing I always tought was that religion is a sham. Ideology and tradition and icons and the like are all a sham.* They don't get you anything.</p>

<p>Jesus said a bunch of things but one concept he always pointed out was that your relationship with God was a personal matter. You don't have to go to church. You don't have to pray in public for everyone to see.* You don't have to do ANY of that crap. The physical church building means nothing. </p>

<p>He even warned against these types of people.*</p>

<p>I know that most people cringe at the sight of anything religious. Michelle will get the joke "They said God. Quick! Change it!". I don't practice anything anymore. I don't want to explain why and I don't want you to try and explain why I should. Even so, I will pray tonight "Lord, protect me from your followers."<br />

** all of the passages below can be researched on <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net">Gospelcom</a> if you don't have a Bible handy. I would suggest you use the NIV translation. It takes the nappy King James and puts it into more modern language. You won't see Jesus telling the parable of the motorcycle but you might actually be able to understand the point being made instead of getting wrapped up in the "Yea verily thou art" language. When I was teaching, I always used an NIV version.</i><br />

<p>To quote <i>"It's just absurd," said David Sifry, chief technology officer for Sputnik, a Wi-Fi network now in the building stages. He says the request is equivalent to asking them to "break the laws of physics" since it would require them to keep the stray emissions at a level equal to the amount of radiation emitted when water evaporates in sunlight. "It's that level of insanity you can't legislate." </i></p>

<span class="title">I've come to the conclusion</span>

<p>that IT managers continue to run Microsoft products in order to justify a large IT budget.</p>


<p>Smart money would tell you that the less money spent on IT infrastructure, is more value to your stock and possibly a bit more in your pocket. Despite all the bs going on my office, I still have this motivation to save the company money. </p>

<p>Will I ever see any of it?  Not likely.<br />
Do I care? Not really.</p>

<p>You wanna know what drives me to linux and unix? The fact that it makes it easier to get my job done. I don't like to have to babysit my servers. I like having the power to customize and optimize to my hearts content and getting things JUST right for the task. I like not having to worry about the BSA busting down my door when all I want to do is test an idea out. I hate that a company that has so much money as Microsoft just can't seem to get it right when it comes to security.</p>

<p>Look. I know that no OS is perfect and you really SHOULD use the best tool for the job. I won't deny that and I've come to accept that. I'm no zealot. I'm sure there are people who could make an OpenBSD install insecure. If you really can make a MS server secure, more power to you. My argument is that it takes more work and babysitting. </p>

<p>Babysitting is NOT the same as maintenance. Every server, linux - *bsd - ms - sun - hp -aix, all need maintenance. It's the nature of the IT beast. What I am saying is that the overall cost associated with running a linux or unix based server is less. I don't have hard numbers but I have experience with it. If you stick with open standards you can never go wrong. I'm sure a Notes server on linux would have just as many problems as on NT but if all you need is email, why aren't you just running IMAP and postfix? </p>

<p>I can't WAIT till some sort of open standards based group scheduling and calendaring takes off. That would really be the final nail in the exchange coffin. I can say with absolute certainty that is the ONLY reason we run exchange. Trust me. I did the investigation to migrate off of it when our last round of licensing came up.</p>

<p>I dunno. I guess it's this nasty pit I get in my stomach everytime I think about my email being stored in some proprietary edb file that I can't just open. I get frustrated when I fire up a machine that has windows installed and it becomes a pain in the ass to find out what processor it has in it. I don't give a fuck about the stepping and family. </p>

<p>Why can't I just 'cat  /proc/cpuinfo'?</p>

<p>You want to know what my problem with Microsoft in the server room is? I feel helpless. It seems to be a chore to find out anything. It seems to be a bitch to do ANYTHING remotely. VNC helps but it's not the same. I want to be able to 'tail -f /var/log/messages' and see in real time what's happening. I don't want to have to hit F5 in event viewer. I'm actually at home in a unix environment. Even after I passed my NT 3.51 tests, I never felt at home.</p>

<p>Here's the crux:</p>

<p> With unix and linux, I don't HAVE to take advantage of all the options if I don't want to but they are there if I need them.<br />
With Microsoft, I don't even have the options.</p>

<p>(fyi: the reason I didn't mention Novell is that I have almost NIL experience in that arena. I only discuss what I know. Or at least what I can bullshit my way through.)</p>

<span class="title">Slashdot goes subscription</span>

<p>Well it seems slashdot plans on going to a subscription service.</p>


<p>"And I could give a rat's ass. </p>

<p>I don't read slashdot as often as I used to. I am an old school slashdot reader too. It just seems that things went the way of the dodo. The trolls took over for a while and that really turned me off. I went over to <a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org"">K5</a> and started getting involved in some discussions that actually involved people of intelligence. People who were over the age of 15 and had actually dealt with and been involved in a corporate job for any amount of time.</p>

<p>But this isn't a rail against slashdot and the current state of affairs. It's about the subscription service they will be using soon. I'm not even going to bitch about the fact that they are charging for something that was once free. Here's what I plan on bitching about.....</p>

<p>slashdot is charging the people who make slashdot so popular.</p>

<p>You see, slashdot doesn't provide any sort of service or any information that couldn't be gotten elsewhere. Sure we can read about Rob proposing to his girlfriend (congrats by the way, and I mean that!). We can read about Jeff's shit getting burned in a fire (way back when). We can even read the Katz stories about C64's in Ashcanistan (or was it an Amiga? ;>) being used to download movies and games for the first time in years if we didn't all have his stories filtered out. </p>

<p>But that's it. There are occasionally some good book reviews (which are contributed by others for the most part), but by in large, slashdot is a collection of links to OTHER things on the web and a discussion about those links from other people. Slashdot doesn't produce anything. The inbreeding that is OSDN does not count. A thinkgeek banner from slashdot doesn't count.</p>

<p>I feel bad for the guys honestly. Slashdot is a monster that *I* wouldn't want to handle. Dealing with 14 yr old dickheads that now are devising ways to cost them as much money as possible is NOT going to be fun but banner ads were and always will be a horrible idea.</p>

<p>The web is NOT the same medium as TV. It doesn't work that way. I think <a href=""http://www.fuckedcompany.com"">pud</a> had it right when he created httpads. </p>

<p>Personally I haven't seen a banner ad in a long time. I used junkbuster (and now guidescope) to filter them out. My time is valuable. Waiting for a page to load because of some wanker-ass punch the monkey banner takes up that time.</p>

<p>What the guys at slashdot need to do is farm themselves out as perl guru's. Maybe write custom extensions to slashcode for companies that need a service like slashdot. I could care less if slashcode was GPL or not. I don't think it would be as powerful as it is today if it weren't but if Rob/Jeff/et. al had said from the start ""Slashdot will always be free but slashcode will not so it can subsidize slashdot itself"" I would have been just as happy. What better advertising can a product want than to be one of the single most popular points on the web and prove it's ability as such?<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is this.</p>

<p>If you plan on starting a website from now on, make everything clear up front. If you provide a tangible service to someone, charge for it from the get go. Find that point where people actually WANT to pay you. Find that balance between free and pay content. Make it worth it. I'm all for opensource. I think it's a viable business model. I think that software will eventually become a commodity and that people will only care to pay when you value add. I buy copies of redhat to this day. Not only because I support the company, but because I like the bumper stickers ;) I don't need a manual. I don't need a getting started guide. I do like having access to system profiles online so I can see at a glance what updates I need for each of my systems. Sure I could do it myself but as I said in before, my time is valuable. When I'm not dealing with Sharp's shitty ass copier products, I'm dealing with a Norstar Modular ICS 4.1 and startalk combination. I'm thinking of ways to help save the company money by using SDMS as a document management system for our sales team.  You see my point? Most of the people who read slashdot and fall under the age of 18 have no clue what it means to make a living. Not all but most. They don't understand what it means to deal with the larger stuff and putting off your own personal agenda in the face of a solution that works.</p>

<p>It all boils down to this: slashdot is going to start charging to block out banner ads and I don't care. </p>

<p>You see, this is my personal website graciously allowed to be hosted by my boss in exchange for a place to host his own website. I can say whatever I want because I control the router.</p>

<p>Oh yeah and if anyone plans on linking this elsewhere (it could happen but it wouldn't matter either way) at least let me know first so I can create a static page for people to use and maybe get a mirror up first."<br />

<span class="title">Shutup and Eat What we feed you!</span>

<p>[from the lusis.org archives]</p>


<p> I watch alot of tv. I mean hella amounts of tv. I even watch tv while Im working on the computer.</p>

<p>Thats not to say I watch more tv than I listen to music but none the less. So Im watching a spot of tv,</p>

<p>and a commercial comes on. At this point I cant even remember what the commercial was about.</p>

<p>(editors note: this entire post is going to be FILLED to the brim with dangling participles if only for the opportunity to stick the words dangling and participles together in a sentence)</p>

<p></p>

<p>So anyway back to the commercial. I have to freakin clue now what it was about but I do remember a few things.</p>

<p><br />
Number 1: It was a beautiful commercial in the esthetic sense of the word. Well crafted and probably cost a fuckton of money to produce.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Number 2: It was peaceful. When all was said and done, I was left with a vast sense of peace and completion. Stay with me, people. Ill get there real quick.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Number 3: For a brief moment, I would have bought a pile of dogshit from this company.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There is one thing in common with all comercials besides the shameless marketing of useless products that we will never use.</p>

<p>Music. Now most people know of my great love for music of all kinds (save a couple of flavors). Companies have been using music for years in the form of jingles.</p>

<p>How many people can still remember jingles that are 10 years old? Heres an example:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nuff said. Music is catchy. We all get songs in our heads that we cant seem to get out. They stick like poorly cooked pasta in the roofs of our minds.</p>

<p>Music engrains the lyrics into our heads. Thats how jingles work.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I just have a feeling that 5 years from now we will all be sitting at home with our families watching tv and a commercial will come on.</p>

<p>There will be no words, no voice overs...nothing. Just a single image of a bird on a tree branch or a a wave crashing on a beach.</p>

<p>Over the top of that image we will hear a steady stream of carefully crafted musical notes. At the end of 20 or 30 seconds, we will be sitting with our families</p>

<p>staring like a deer caught in headlights at our 50 inch wall panel tv wondering why we feel so incomplete. We will then get dressed in our brand new clothes,</p>

<p>pile into our brand new ford aerostar van and drive down to the local store en masse to purchase that brand spankin new, shiny toothbrush that we cant live without.</p>

<p>Well come back home to watch more tv and lather, rinse, repeat the entire process, becuase if we dont we will never feel complete, comfortable or at peace.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Dont feed the shit they feed you. Id go outside and stare at the sun right now but its too cold.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Maybe I should just go to the fridge, get another tasty beverage, call the local delivery place to order something on my fancy credit card and sit down and watch more television. </p>
