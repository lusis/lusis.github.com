<span class="title">Stupid Redhat Tricks</span>

<p>Okay so it's not stupid but really freakin cool.</p>


<p>We were getting ready to repurpose a server at the office. The server was located at the datacenter and we really didn't want to go onsite for a freakin install if we could help it.</p>

<p>Specs:<br />
IBM x345 server<br />
BIOS Console Over Serial<br />
Cyclades Alterpath 32<br />
RHEL2.1AS<br />
IBM DB2 UDB 8.1fp4</p>

<p>So we've now consolidated some of our database servers into multiple instances on a beefier box. We getting ready to replace our reporting server package (Espress Reports) with Actuate iServer.</p>

<p>Actuate iServer supports RHEL3 minimum. This migration has been pushed back for a few weeks because of licensing issues and we finally have the pieces in place.</p>

<p>Now we realize that we need to upgrade the server. Trying to avoid a trip to the datacenter and any more delay, we call RedHat support and ask if we can just subscribe the old server to a new channel and run up2date. It was a long shot and just as I feared a non-start of an idea. We put our heads together and realize that worst case, someone has to drive down and insert a bootcd even to do an FTP install. Then the redhat guy comes up with the idea of:</p>

<p>You *COULD* copy the vmlinux and initrd from the boot cd over to /boot on the server. Then make a grub entry for booting those kernels and do an FTP install. But that would require a GUI. I know there's a VNC install option but I'll dig up the info and email it to you.</p>

<p>Not wanting to wait we think again the worst that happens is that we have to drive down and do the install onsite. Not a big problem but why not give this a shot.</p>

<p>So we set the GRUB entry as follows:</p>

<p>title=Boot CD Install Kernel<br />
root=(hd0,0)<br />
kernel=/vmlinuz.cdboot<br />
initrd=initrd.cdboot text</p>

<p>We added the text option just so it wouldn't try and go into a gui. I think it didn't matter because as I look back, the "text" option actually doesn't go there?</p>

<p>We put the cd source on an internal FTP server, logged into the console port on the cyclades and rebooted the server.</p>

<p>We were presented with the GRUB menu over the serial port and selected the CD Install kernel to boot.</p>

<p>The system booted up into a text-only install of RHEL3. We selected FTP install and went through our normal steps selecting the proper packages and 20 minutes later (no shit, we timed it) we we're rebooted into our new system already on the network.</p>

<p>This is amazing to say the least. I've been doing this for 10 years now and never even THOUGHT to try it. It just isn't a tip that you normally think about. That's why I'm posting it here.</p>

<p>As an aside, we're preparing to do this for all of our servers. We'll be copying the appropriate vmlinuz and initrd files from the distributions we use to each server and making boot menu options for them. Since all of the servers are running Linux and are connected to a Cyclades for OOB access, we get full visibility from bootup to shutdown.  </p>

<p>I'm sure many people would have suggested something along the lines of a PXE server (which I've done in the past) or leaving a boot floppy in all the servers and disabling floppy boot in the BIOS.</p>

<p>As to the PXE thing, we don't have a DHCP server running at any of our datacenters. We also disable all unused network ports on the switches but it's one less security hole I have to worry about notwithstanding another service I have to maintain. We already have an internal FTP server that can house the basic packages to get a server up and running and our Gentoo servers are network install ANYWAY.</p>

<p>As for the floppy option, it's about saving time. It's much quicker to boot from disk than ready everything from the floppy and the size of the vmlinuz and initrd are floppy prohibitive. Maybe a custom boot cd in all the servers would work as well. but that's just another thing we have to remember.</p>

<p>I'm going to throw some keywords in here just to help people find this tip. I really think it's a cool tip for any SA to have that manages linux servers:</p>

<p>grub, ftp install, redhat, RHEL, initrd, vmlinuz, boot cd</p>

<span class="title">John's Ad Block</span>

<p><a title="John's Ad Blocker" href="http://www.lusis.org/static/johnsadblock.xpi">Mozilla/Netscape7/Firebird adblocker</a> (right-click and save to desktop. Then open with Mozilla)</p>


<p>So I was playing around with <a href="http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/" title="Flash click-to-view">this package</a> because pulling the xml file over the internet was really dragging down flash pages. After installing I realized that it 1) overwrote my userContent.css and 2) wouldn't install to my user profile directory.</p>

<p>After googling a bit, I found out that 1) xpi files are just zip files and 2) making an app install in the user profile directory is as easy as changing 2 lines in the install.js.</p>

<p>That led me to package my userContent.css with Ted's click to view changes. The result is my nifty adblocker along with the flash click to view installed locally in the user profile directory.</p>

<p>The upshot is that I can easy install the app without having to navigate to the profile directory and all that.</p>

<p>Let me know if you use it. I might decide to play around with some mozilla plugins a bit more.</p>

<p>Edit: If anyone has any ideas as to why apache wants to serve this file as text, I'd appreciate it. I've added "AddType application/x-xpinstall .xpi" to my .htaccess but its not making any difference. Seems to only be happening on windows.</p>

<p><a title="" href="http://www.lusis.org/static/userContent.css">Updated usercontent stylesheet</a></p>


<p>I've updated my file. I added:</p>

<pre>
IFRAME[SRC*="/html.ng"]  { display: none ! important }</pre>

<p>under the iframe section. It was already listed up under the IMG SRC entries but not for iframes. </p>

<p>The main reason for this is that stratics forums uses mediamgr.ugo.com for alot of the ads and the site runs DOG SLOW.</p>

<p>When are people going to realize that text ads work much better. People are assuming stratics forums are slow when the real problem is off-site third party banner ads!</p>

<p>Another update: I've found a link that discusses where mozilla stores it's profiles for each OS. Alot of people have asked me where in the hell to actually put the userContent.css file.</p>

<p>This is straight from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.0/#profiles">mozilla.org:</a></p>

<p>Profile Locations<br />
Windows %USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Mozilla\Profiles\[Profile Name]\[random string].slt\<br />

<span class="title">Help for a troubled web browser</span>

<p>People have been griping on the stratics forums about the banner ads now that customers have been forced to go there for support. I humbly offer these tips to help everyone.</p>


<p>1) Download <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">mozilla.</a></p>

<p>2) Download <a href="http://www.lusis.org/static/userContent.css">file</a>. I've added some changes for flash ads. If anyone can get the yahoo flash ads as well, let me know and I'll integrate the changes. They use some javascript funkyness.</p>

<p>3) Put it in the appropriate directory. It goes into the chrome directory for your profile. Check <a href="http://www.flii.us/myworks/phoenix/pages/chrome.html">this site</a> for an example. It's uses the phoenix directory but replace  Phoenix in the examples with Mozilla.</p>

<p>4) Browse the web snappy-like!</p>

<span class="title">Quick and dirty hack for PDF printing</span>

<p>I mentioned this on newsforge in response to the StarOffice article. I wanted to put a copy here for people who might not see that article.</p>


<p>"The facts:</p>

<p>1 - We need to cut costs. <br />
2 - We have an occasional need to print to pdf format. <br />
3 - Adobe PDF writer is expensive. <br />
4 - What does John think we should do?</p>

<p>After thinking for a moment, I came to another set of facts.</p>

<p>1 - Under kde, I can print to pdf.<br />
2 - I need the same thing on a network.<br />
3 - Many printer drivers are postscript.<br />
4 - Ghostscript has a ps2pdf command.</p>

<p>How could I leverage this to my advantage?</p>

<p>I googled a bit for a solution. I found a couple of sample scripts but nothing that fit the bill exactly. Below you can find the script I use as well as a section from my smb.conf for the printer:<br />
<pre><br />
#!/bin/sh<br />
# I straight up stole this from somewhere on the web. I added alot of my own stuff. - JEV<br />
DATE=`date +%b%d-%H%M%S`</p>

<p>OUTDIR=/shr/pdfdropbox</p>

<p># take the input from a postscript printdriver and convert to pdf<br />
ps2pdf13 $1 $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.temp<br />
# optimize for quicker loading in Acrobat<br />
pdfopt $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.temp $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.pdf<br />
# Grab a snapshot in text format of the first page of the document to add to the email body<br />
pdftotext -f 1 -l 1 $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.pdf $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.txt<br />
# use mpack to mail the file along with using the first page of the document in <br />
# text format as the message body</p>

<p># this is fairly limited because it will only send to someone on OUR mailserver<br />
mpack -s ""PDF file - First page in message body"" -d $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.txt  \\<br />
$OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.pdf $2@yourdomainhere.com</p>

<p># clean up all the random shit we left lying around<br />
rm -rf $1 $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.*<br />
</pre><br />
from smb.conf:<br />
<pre><br />
[PDF Printer]<br />
        comment = PDF Printer<br />
        path = /tmp<br />
        # force user = nobody<br />
        guest ok = Yes<br />
        printable = Yes<br />
        print command = /usr/bin/printpdf %s %U<br />
</pre><br />
You'll need mpack which you can get <a href=""http://www.pcc.com/~jay/src/mail_news/mpack-1.5/ORIGINALS/"">here</a>. You could do the same thing with metamail (as the link says) but I was in a hurry.</p>

<p>Under windows, we set up the printer as an HP Color LaserJet 5/5M PS. This is a good solid Postscript printer driver. Set it always to color and you're all set. Here's an example of the email it sends you. The text below is the body of the email message:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.lusis.org/samplepdf.pdf"">Here</a> is an example of the printed pdf. I only printed the first page and I also set it for landscape mode.</p>

<p>A few caveats:<br />
1 - Some fonts look like ass no matter what. This isn't an issue since the things we print to pdf are pretty standard.<br />
2 - No security whatsoever.This seems to be soley in the domain of Adobe. And we all know what to think of adobe and security eh?<br />
3 - No extra features. Like I said, this is a pretty limited and at the same time powerful solution. If you don't need a password protected pdf or any of the nifty indexing features, this is your tool.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone somewhere.</p>
