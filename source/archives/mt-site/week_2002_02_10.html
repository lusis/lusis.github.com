<span class="title">Sendmail stuff</span>

<p>Sendmail sucks</p>


<p>I've been f'ing around with sendmail to make some spam changes. I might or might not have messed up the mailserver. All this in light of my nifty post on slashdot. Actually it's just some virtual user stuff. If any of my users have any problem getting mail or mail showing up in the from field to other people, let me know. I'll take a whack at fixing it.</p>

<p>Update: Sendmail sucks so much I'm going to install postfix tonight. Mail services will be down for a bit whilst I do all that.</p>

<span class="title">I don't get viruses damnit!</span>

<p>At least that's what I thought until I walked into work this morning.</p>


<p>Actually I didn't get a virus but when I walked into work this morning, my daily scan from Norton Antivirus assured me that I did.</p>

<p>It seems that the zlib dll that cygwin installs is now the same name as a virus backdoor.</p>

<p>Norton antivirus was happy to quarantine cygz.dll on my behalf, thinking that it was a virus. After assuring myself with a few google searches, I unquarantined the file and went on my merry way.</p>

<p>I'm actually going to fire off an email to both symantec and the cygwin folks about the whole thing.</p>

<span class="title">Gotta love IBM</span>

<p>"Why would someone that good, play for nothing?"</p>


<p>"Because he loves the game. He loves the game"</p>

<p>Basically the commercial is a bunch of guys playing basketball. On each person's uniform is a name like "wireless" or "web" or "ecommerce".</p>

<p>The coach introduces the newest teamate "Linux" to the team. He procedes to pull a MJ (pre-Washington Wizards Jordon) and dunk all over the place. The quotes above are from a meeting that two guys are having about the new guy.</p>

<p>I have to tell you this is the best commercial for linux yet. "The Hiest" was cool and all but this really smacks it to the PHB's saying that something free can't be any good.</p>

<p>Rock on IBM!</p>
