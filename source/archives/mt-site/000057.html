<p>Well I won't be able to vote next week.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>It seems a dopped ball  with the transfer of my voter registration information from Cobb to Fulton county is to blame. When I went to vote in the 2000 elections, I was told that I wasn't registered in Fulton County. They pointed me to the proper precint in Cobb County and said that they would transfer my information when I filled out a form there.</p>

<p>So I go to Cobb County and fill out my forms and vote. I didn't leave the poll until 7:30 and the polls closed at 7! It was a busy time.</p>

<p><br />
I went on the Secretary of State's website to find my polling station and it turns out I'm not listed. i checked Cobb County and nothing there. I call Fulton but the computers are down. I call Cobb and they tell me I was dropped from the rolls in June of 2001. I call Fulton back and explain all that to them. They tell me nothing can be done but the ball was dropped somewhere on the part of the two counties. I'm depressed but I make one last stab and call the Sec. of State's office directly.</p>

<p>After being transferred around 2 or three times, I finally get to the ""guru"" of voter registration. She basically tells me that if I had gotten to them a week earlier they might have been able to do something but I was out of luck now. Basically the two step transfer of registration only made it to step one..being dropped from Cobb County.</p>

<p>I'm really bummed by this. Michelle jokingly asked me if I wanted her to vote for me. Obviously I would never ask her to do that. I can only hope that the people I discuss politics with have come to think about the long-term effects of the people they choose to represent them.</p>

<p>Good luck to all the candidates running. While I probably wouldn't have voted for the majority of you, I still thank you for putting your lives up on the block in an effort to effect change in this country and state (however misguided I might think it to be).</p>

<p>To those of you voting, remember to vote in accordance with how you feel. You don't HAVE to choose one of the two major parties. Even if you vote Green or Libertarian or Independant, you're showing everyone else that being strangled by a two-party system that doesn't want the competition from fresh ideas presented by those parties that you won't be silenced.</p>
