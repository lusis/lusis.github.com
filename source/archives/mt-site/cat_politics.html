<p>We own two. One is a 12 guage shotgun and the other is a 16. Make sure you have plenty of shells handy. Keep it by your bedside if you have to. Keep the gun lock on it to protect your children.</p>

<p>Now when you hear the bulldozers, look out your window. If they're not coming to tear down your house, but your neighbors, then go stand by your neighbor.</p>

<p>Alot of the above is extreme but it may come to that. Not today, not tomorrow but it will.</p>

<p>That is if things don't change.</p>

<p>Screw Republicans who support only big business and screw Democrats who thing the government should be all reaching.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theday.com/eng/web/news/re.aspx?re=0BFE6861-3C00-40D9-867C-09ADF6FDF468" title=New London, CT>You can read about it here</a></p>

<p>Our illustrious SCOTUS has ruled that governments can exercise eminent domain to increase a tax base.</p>

<p>This is what Justice Stevens, a Republican Justice, had to say:</p>

<quote>
“The city has carefully formulated an economic development that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including — but by no means limited to — new jobs and increased tax revenue,”
</quote>

<p>NOT LIMITED TO?!?!?!</p>

<p>What's next, taking property from a neighborhood because it's full of black families who don't pay as much in taxes as the white families who want it?</p>

<p>People who know me know that I am not sympathetic to poverty. I've been without a job and sleeping on a couch before. I'm also a capitalist. I'm all for the free market but goddamn it. We have inalienable rights. Or was that part torn out already? The government doesn't grant us those rights. They're inherent. The government's job is to ensure that we don't lose those rights.</p>

<p>Let me remind you of what the Declaration of Independance says:</p>

<p>-That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,</p>

<p>The fifth amendment says this:</p>

<p>"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."</p>

<p>By having expanded the definition of public use with today's ruling to include increased tax revenue and new jobs, no one is left with security that thier home is thier own. If your property value ever drops and a company like Pfiezer or Walmart wants to build a new greyfield, the government now has the ability to take that property on the fact that it might create new jobs.</p>

<p>Nevermind the string of buildings that Walmart leaves behind weekly to build a new SuperDooper Walmart 5 miles away.</p>

<p>Those of you who vote Republican, you are no better than those who vote Democrat. It's the same wolf with a different accent. I beg you. Consider the alternate parties. Consider voting Libertarian as I do. You may not agree with entire party line but rest assured that the purpose of the party platform is to ensure that individual rights enshirined by the Constitution are preserved. This sometimes means giving rights to people you can't stand or giving them the right to throw a punch but it also insures your right to have that punch stop before it hits you. </p>

<p>Read the Consitution. Read the Declaration of Independance. Read 1776. Understand what the hell we were fighting for and what people did to ensure that it happened. Understand it.  Live it. There are a ton of things that I think are wrong in this world. I think abortion is horrible and stupid and immoral but I would never support the overturning or weakening of Roe v. Wade. Why?</p>

<p>Simple, it is not the job of the government to enforce my personal moral code on someone else. I can understand the separatation of personal convictions vs.anothers rights.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of homosexual marriage but I will tell you this I would never want the government to deny someone the right to marry the person they want. Why? Because a free society doesn't do that sort of thing. </p>

<p>All of these things are one step away from total government control of my life and I don't want that. "I said nothing because they weren't coming for me. When they finally came for me there was no one to say anything"</p>

<p>Some things are not up for debate. My life, my liberty. Those are things you cannot take away. </p>

<p>You try and I'll be waiting. Waiting to stop the bulldozers. And I'll stand by you to stop the bulldozers too.</p>

<span class="title">Campaign Finance Act and Free Speech</span>

<p>I know it's been a while since I've posted but things have gotten to the point where I can again and I've found the perfect topic to rant about.</p>


<p>To everyone who voted FOR the Campaign Reform Act, thank you! To all of those who supported it, thank you! </p>

<p>In case you couldn't tell, that was sarcasm. I guess now anytime I write anything political or post a link to an LP website, I'll soon be in violation of Federal law.</p>

<p>When are people going to wake up and realize that the stupid laws they try and pass ALWAYS have unintended consequences? I want my elected officials to stop and think about that for about 2 minutes. Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>I'm going to post the links here at the end but the premise is this, Soft money contribution laws are soon about to apply to the Internet. It's going to apply to blogs. </p>

<p>Think about this. The Federal Government is now going to be able to supress free political speech on the Internet because it can be qualified as "soft money". You can read the questions that <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/">Declan McCullagh</a> poses to a FEC commissioner at <a href="http://news.com.com/The+coming+crackdown+on+blogging/2008-1028_3-5597079.html">C|Net</a> today.</p>

<p>Here's the last Q/A from the article which really sums up how scary this thing is:</p>

<p>"Q: So if you're using text that the campaign sends you, and you're reproducing it on your blog or forwarding it to a mailing list, you could be in trouble?</p>

<p>A: Yes. In fact, the regulations are very specific that reproducing a campaign's material is a reproduction for purpose of triggering the law. That'll count as an expenditure that counts against campaign finance law.</p>

<p>This is an incredible thicket. If someone else doesn't take action, for instance in Congress, we're running a real possibility of serious Internet regulation. It's going to be bizarre"</p>

<p>So thanks McCain and thanks Feingold! The world is a better place because of both of you!</p>

<p>I found this wonderful tidbit via <a href="http://nataliesolent.blogspot.com/2003_07_06_nataliesolent_archive.html#105753212650608636" title="Natalie Solent">Natalie Solent's blog</a>.</p>

<p>It's an amazing story from a Kenyan woman about globalization and how free markets lead to higher standards of living. </p>

<p>The best quote was this:</p>

<p><i>I was introduced formally to freedom and free market by reading books on freedom. The insights it offered were crystal clear. Presenting to me questions I had never contemplated before, such as what the proper role of government is, and the idea that protection of life, liberty and property were the only functions that could be justified in the existence of governments.</i><br />

<p>Interesting article cowritten by the founder of <a href="http://www.cato.org" title="The Cato Institute">The Cato Institute</a> and its chairman. I&apos;m still digging for an interesting article that Michelle sent me about a sort of NeoCon cabal involving Wolfie, Cheney and a few others. I&apos;m now starting to agree with some people that Bush was handpicked because of his name and maliability to the whims of some extreme right-wing (god I hate phrases like that) politicals. </p>

<p>Make no mistake people, the Republicans are no more interested in limited Federal government than the Dems are.</p>

<p><a title="Weapons of mass destruction were never the real issue" href="http://www.ajc.com/print/content/epaper/editions/wednesday/opinion_e3ddf850e14eb1df00f6.html">Welcome to AJC!</a></p>


<p>Let me say this. Recently I've been feeling like I bought into some sort of lie. </p>

<p>I was the first to admit that I never felt threatened by Iraq. My thought was that I trusted Colin Powell more than the UN.</p>

<p>After all is said and done, I pick up a <a href="http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/index.html" title="website not really up to date">periodical</a> a few weeks ago at Barnes and Noble while getting a few study guides for the CCNA.</p>

<p>In this magazine, there was an article that disected the GWB speech before we went to war (the 48 hours speech). After various parts, the writer would add his commentary. He made some interesting points. Much of it centered around the LP policy of foriegn involvement. His point was that while Saddam was an asshole (my words) and deserved whatever came to him, the information regarding WOMDs was inaccurate and that even if it were valid, Iraq is a soveriegn state and that we had no right to attack them.</p>

<p>Let me make a few points. </p>

<p>I don't care how many people think that the 9-11 attackers came from Iraq. That proves nothing except the stupidity of the uneducated populace.</p>

<p>I don't care that some people are calling the war illegal. My interpretation is that the original UN resolution gave any member of the security council the right to enforce disarmament. I don't like the UN one bit but they did make the rule.</p>

<p>Things in the world are alot closer now.  Someone over in the middle east can pose a threat to our national security and not be on our shores. 9-11 itself proved that the definition of a threat has grown. </p>

<p>Either way, while Friedman (a writer who I love reading and usually agree with) says that he would have accepted that we had to attack Iraq for stability in the Middle East, I don't think I would have. I just wish I hadn't bought into the bull. I'm too smart for that.</p>

<p><a title="Poor Republicans" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/21/santorum.gays.ap/index.html">CNN.com - Gay groups criticize Santorum remarks as insensitive - Apr. 21, 2003</a></p>

<p><br />
</p>


<p>Quoth Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p><i>"If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual (gay) sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything"</i></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><i>"All of those things are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family," Santorum said. "And that's sort of where we are in today's world, unfortunately. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn't exist, in my opinion, in the United States Constitution."</i></p>

<p>Everyone cheer the GOP!  This man is a verified loon (according to someone close to me.).</p>

<p>Let's take apart some of this:</p>

<p>Polygamy - a moral issue. Nothing more. There is no scientific reason or legal reason I can think of that I man or woman shouldn't be allowed to have any type of relationship he wishes. </p>

<p>Bigamy - the legal term of polygamy. A plurality of spouses and nothing more. Same as argument for polygamy.</p>

<p>Incest - There is a scientific basis for the laws against this. Besides that, incest issues usually arise from parents raping children against the will of the child. A whole other legal issue there.</p>

<p>Adultery - While it's ground for legal divorce, it's still a moral issue if anything. </p>

<p>The fact that he would relate the behaviour of two CONSENTING adults to engage in behaviour CONSENTED to by the aforementioned CONSENTING adults is just silly.</p>

<p>Of course we get to the meat of the matter in a later statement. These behaviours are antiethical to a stable, healthy, traditional family! OF COURSE!</p>

<p>Traditions change folks. Do we still give goats as dowry? I hope not! When Michelle and I were at the Dogwood Festival, we took a break to eat lunch. As we were sitting there, I noticed a gay couple on the blanket across from us. In Atlanta, this is no big deal. What was interesting is that these two gay men, a couple, were taking care of a baby. They took turns feeding and rocking and burping and doing all the things that parents would do. I pointed it out and we remarked on it for a while. Sure we saw straight couples behaving the same way but none of them exhibited the overt love and joy that these two men did over that child. There are bad eggs in every family but I'm guessing that child gets more love than a child in most straight families.</p>

<p>I say to you again, "The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."</p>

<p>You may feel that God is going to strike down the United States because of the behaviour of its immorality but I will tell you that a government that avoids legislating the personal morality of one man over another is the only one in which you would be allowed to have that belief.</p>

<p>And as to his comment about a false sense of privacy, it is true that it is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution but, to take a quote from the ACLU:</p>

<p><i>"WHAT IS THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY?</p>

<p>The right to privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court has said that several of the amendments create this right. One of the amendments is the Fourth Amendment, which stops the police and other government agents from searching us or our property without "probable cause" to believe that we have committed a crime. Other amendments protect our freedom to make certain decisions about our bodies and our private lives without interference from the government </i>"</p>

<p>It seems that the Supremes would disagree with the Senator's Constitutional Law understanding.</p>

<p>You may have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom of consequences. The government cannot restrict your right to speech (within reason - fire in a crowded theater) but that doesn't mean that the public can't make judegements about you based on your speech.</p>

<p>Just as I judge the Dixie Chicks and Michael Moore, so I judge Senator Santorum. </p>

<p>Blithering idiot.</p>

<p>As a side note, this guy has a history of trying to force his morality into law and making statements as such:</p>

<p>Many people are aware of the stink I've raised over Jose Padilla and Mike Hawash. I'm also an ardent opposer of the "Patriot II" act that the Bush administration is trying to get through right now.</p>

<p>I was NOT however aware of this issue. It seems that John Ashcroft and the rest of this administration will go to ANY length to violate the constitution in its pursuit of safety. This cannot happen. Don't think that because you are a Democrat or a Republican that this will be shot down. You MUST contact the relevent congresscritters and do something about this. Both Republicans and Democrats would LOVE to be able to stiffle free speech and freedom of association to suit a specific set of goals. Currently that pesky Constitution is standing in the way. If they can strip you of citizenship based on some arbitrary association or statement or action, then they won't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Note this section from the article closely<br />
<i>The law states that a person's intent to relinquish his or her citizenship can be inferred from conduct. Indeed, the same conduct that constitutes the "expatriating act" – for example, the act of funding the Chechen orphanage – could provide a sufficient basis for concluding that the person intended to give up his or her citizenship. Although the person would be able to try to challenge this determination in court, he or she would not necessarily succeed.</i></p>

<p>Take heed people, you need to stand up for your freedoms as citizens of this country.</p>

<p>This is just the text of those messages. While Bush and Blair express the same exact sentiment, I still love Tony Blair's speaking ability.</p>

<p>It's confirmed. I'm a Tony Blair groupie! </p>

<p>As to the meat of the message, I think these words were the BEST way to disarm any sort of "arab insecurity". The Arab community is an extremely prideful nation. While they wanted to see Saddam go, it hurts to see the most cocksure of Arab nations fall in fairly short order. I think both Bush and Blair made it clear that we will be out as soon as possible. Let's hope that holds true.</p>

Many people see this as a threat to the social bond and a sign of the failure of our integration model. This may well have been a significant factor in our government&apos;s decision to adopt its stance in the UN. Anything that would stir tensions between communities is regarded as a bad thing for our country. We already see too many people overtly supporting Saddam or shouting anti-semitic slogans in anti-war protests. And believe it or not, this is a real concern for us."

<p>Well the original story was about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/03/2327239&tid=95" title="googlewashing and second superpowers">Googlewashing</a> but it was in the context of the phrase "second superpower".</p>

<p>After reading the second superpower article, I had a bit of an itch to scratch. My language was probably less than productive but I really had to scratch! I got a wonderful response from ThinWhiteDuke who happens to be French.</p>

<p>As usual, I've quoted Thomas Jefferson way too much. I've also stepped outside of a rational discussion at some point with my choice of words .</p>

<p>I randomly found this site on the web this afternoon and got sick to my stomach. I don't know anything about the guy only what I've read on the website and the linked <a title="Original Oregonian Article" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/104825159914540.xml">Oregonian website</a> as well as <a title="Letter to the Editor by Mike's friend" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/letters/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/104859701879330.xml">the letter to the editor</a> by one of his co-workers.</p>

<p>My understanding is that contributions he made to one of the charities that was later to be determined as funding terrorist activities is the reason behind this.</p>

<p>This really underscores a greater problem with the Patriot Act and John Ashcroft. That is the fact that he is a menace to this country and the Constitution of the United States, a document that I hold most dear to my heart. I also blame the congresscritters who allowed it to happen. </p>

<p>I don't care if this man was plotting to blow up the entire state of Oregon. He's a goddamned UNITED STATES CITIZEN. Doesn't that mean anything to anyone anymore? Oh wait, he's middle eastern. He's a terrorist. GET HIM! Forget the fact that he has rights confered to him as a UNITED STATES CITIZEN!</p>

<p>They may find out that he was actively involved in a plot to release a dirty bomb at Intel. I don't care. The fucking federal government has to operate within the fucking rules that were laid down in this country by people who left England to avoid this sort of thing. Due process you bastards. </p>

<p>I relish the day when we find out that the Red Cross has been indirectly sponsoring some sort of terrorist campaign. Then maybe we'll find a list of donors that has John Ashcroft on it. He might have some time to think about what he's done to this country while he's getting the living shit beat out of him by some overzelous FBI agent.</p>

<p>This whole post may land ME in a cell next to "Mike" Hawash. At least then I can apologize to him for wasting his time learning the Constitution and becoming a citizen. I'd rather KNOW that I'm living in fear under a dictator than having a false sense of security.</p>

<p>Do we really feel any safer?</p>

<span class="title">Gilmore gets it WRONG</span>

<p>Well during my daily reading of cryptome, I found that the main link was in reagards to the U.S. media not showing the video and pictures of the POW's who were killed in Iraq.</p>


<p>I didn't realize that it actually had screengrabs. I'm a bit freaked out. Gilmore gets one thing wrong though. And being such a big point that he got wrong, I've lost alot of respect for him.</p>

<p>He signs the page with "Yours against censorship". He seems to think that the footage not being shown on US airwaves is one of censorship. It was not. I suggest he go and read up on what censorship is. Censorship is created by governments, not private businesses and organizations.</p>

<p>Is it censorship for me, as a private business owner, to not allow you to wear a shirt with some random message on it? No.</p>

<p>Is it censorship for the police to forbid you from saying or publishing the selfsame message? Yes. </p>

<p>The news media were asked by the administration NOT to air the footage. The networks were under no state restriction to hold it back.</p>

<p>The honored that request out of respect for families that might not have been notified that thier son or daughter was KIA. How would you like to see your brother or sister lying dead on the ground with a hole in the forehead while the jackass with the gun is standing there gloating? You wouldn't. Now imagine that being broadcast on national television. See the point?</p>

<p>Mr. Gilmore, you got it wrong sir. I feel for you not being able to see the difference. If your opposition to this conflict removes your respect for your fellow man, then you've lost your way.</p>

<p>It's only two pages but it approaches certain aspects of this case that I agree and disagree with.</p>

<p>There's an attempt to argue states rights (something I'm in favor of) and community-dictated standards.</p>

<p>The other side is that if this appeal is lost, it opens up the door to all sorts of government nosiness in the bedrooms of millions of americans. It also makes mention of a case I was unfamiliar with that involved an inter-racial relationship.</p>

<p>It started to get REALLY good right before the transcript was cut short.</p>

<p><i>JUSTICE STEPHEN G. BREYER But the argument of Bowers, to overrule Bowers, is not directly related to sodomy. It's related, but not directly. It's that people in their own bedrooms, which have their right to do basically what they want, it's not hurting other people. And they, the other side, says Bowers understated the importance of that. It got the history wrong. It didn't understand the relationship of the sodomy to families, and, in addition, Bowers has proved to be harmful to thousands and thousands and thousands of people, if not because they're going to be prosecuted, because they fear it, they might be, which makes it a possible instrument of repression in the hands of the prosecutors. Now, that's the kind of argument that they're making. Harmful in consequence, wrong in theory, understating the constitutional value.</i></p>

<p>One of the arguments is that this indirectly discrimates based on sexual preference because now couples who have engaged in a private act in the confines of private property are now labled as criminals because they have a record.</p>

<p>Anyone know where I can get a rolling transcript or do I have to wait for the close of the day?</p>

<p>Michelle and I were talking about the whole Dixie Chick's fiasco and we ended up on public opinion and private rights.</p>


<p>I ended up on this thread on google groups:</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=lang_en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&threadm=2rf97v0me4svdfdn23ek2g781cf36nf8em%404ax.com&rnum=3&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dprivate%2Bbusiness%2B%252B%2Bno%2Bservice%2B%252B%2Bdiscrimination%26hl%3Den%26lr%3Dlang_en%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26safe%3Doff%26scoring%3Dd%26selm%3D2rf97v0me4svdfdn23ek2g781cf36nf8em%25404ax.com%26rnum%3D3">Google Groups</a></p>

<p>We were discussing how people will discriminate based on political opinion and such. I think the whole boycott of the Dixie Chicks is stupid and that people place to high an opinion on what celebs say. I'm of the opinion that discrimination is fine by a private business or individual is totally legit as it holds to private property rights. The courts have typically agreed with the exception of certain protected classes. One quote really jumped out at me though:</p>

<p>"Service can legally be refused for _proselytizing_ one's religion (and<br />
refusing to stop when so ordered), but that's different from _having_<br />
a religious belief (even if that belief requires proselytizing)."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/ac/?id=110003062">Sex, Drugs And Rock-n-Roll!</a> is the title of a nice article on the libertarian differences with convservatives.</p>


<p>One thing I've heard Neal Boortz say time and time again is that he guarantees that he values freedom more than you. I would say the same thing about myself.</p>

<p>Let me discuss some examples about my personal philosophy in terms of a hot topic issue...abortion.</p>

<p>I'm against abortion. I don't like the thought of it being used as a form of birth control. I don't like what it says about a society. It just doesn't sit well with me.</p>

<p>Having read that you may think, "You're against a woman's right to choose!".</p>

<p>You would be wrong.</p>

<p>Abortion is a moral issue. My feelings on the subject are based soley in my own moral founding. Because of that, I don't think that the government has any business saying what a person can do with her own body.</p>

<p>You see, I think that government has NO business in anyone's personal life. I don't feel that it is proper for a government to try and legislate morality. As long as a person's behaviour doesn't affect deprive me of life, liberty and personal property, the gubment has no business making a ruling one way or the other.</p>

<p>It is because of this alone that I am a libertarian. I value personal liberty above all else.  I cannot, in my heart and mind and soul, expect personal freedom, if I am not willing to extend that self same freedom to someone who shares a different belief system.</p>

<p>People often tell me that libertarian ideas are nice in theory but things that they propose have not been tested. I say hogwash. The principles of the LP and indeed and right-thinking freedom loving individual are the selfsame ideas that this country was founded on. </p>

<p>"How would our government survive without income tax?!?!?"<br />
- Read up on tax history. The country did just fine without it until the early part of the 1900's.</p>

<p>"Drugs are bad! They must be illegal!"<br />
- Yes drugs are bad. So is booze. We tried this with prohibition. Worked well didn't it? What trouble does it cause you if Bill decides to smoke a joint before bed? How does it deprive you of your life, your liberty or your own personal property. I'm not saying it shouldn't be regualted. In fact, I think it should be handled just like alchohol is handled today. DUI and all.</p>

<p>There is one quote from someone who I believe to be the most freedom-minded individual in history, Thomas Jefferson. It sums up everything I believe about freedom and government and politics. Readi t and think about it. You might actually be enlightened.</p>

<p><B>"The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."</B><i>--Thomas Jefferson</i><br />

<p>Well it was interesting and a bit horror movie-ish but one thing scared me more than anything else.</p>


<p>The person chosen to stay out in case of attack was John Ashcroft. That's a hell of alot scarier than Saddam Hussein and Vx nerve gas.</p>

<p>I told Michelle:<br />
"That's scary. I wonder where he falls on the "Everyone else got blowed up" tree.</p>

<p>Discuss and have trouble sleeping amongst yourselves when you think about John Ashcroft as President.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/forms/printThis.html?id=110002965">Zell Miller does an editorial</a> for WSJ OpinionJournal and I weep that we're loosing him.</p>


<p>Zell hits the nail on the head in this one. It seems he understands that you can't reduce taxes without reducing government spending. If I'm expected and encouraged to budget and plan financially, why in the hell shouldn't the Federal Government?</p>

<p>UPDATE:<br />
You should also read <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/1750552"> this article</a> to see some numbers and see that the problem is the fault of both Dems and Repubs.</p>

<span class="title">checks and balances: Bush Administration reminder</span>

<p>Jose Padilla gets to see his lawyers!</p>


<p>Now before I go any further, let me say that i think the guy is scum. I think he is useless and that I hope he gets the full force of the law brought against him.</p>

<p>Some of you may not remember. I'm guessing the Bush Administration and the Ashcroft Regime was happy if that's the case.</p>

<p>An American citizen was being held illegally by the military. He was denied Due Process and all his rights were stripped.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that. </p>

<p>And American citizen. Just like you and just like me. Not someone in the States on a Visa. Nothing at all like that. Mind you he's a criminal with a gang record, but he is still a citizen and by the U.S. Constitution, entitled to certain rights as such.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was detained by the government for having SUSPECTED ties to Al Qaeda. They said he MIGHT have been involved in a plot to detonate a dirty bomb.</p>

<p>Let's cut through all the emotional rhetoric and get down to what this really is.</p>

<p>Despite his ties, if any, to Al Qaeda, this was a citizen of this country who was arrested for his thoughts.</p>

<p>Thoughtcrime.</p>

<p>The government claimed he was an "enemy combatant" and therefore his rights were out the window. </p>

<p>Jose Padilla didn't rise up and take arms against the U.S. He was arrested on a material witness warrant and secretly held in a government prison.</p>

<p>This vague "enemy combatant" crap has to go. He didn't DO anything. The government had to nothing but label him and he looses all his rights? I don't remember reading that part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>As bad as some people think it sounds, there are different rules for citizens and non-citizens. If you want the protection of the Constitution of the United States, only one thing is asked in return. That is to be a citizen of the United States. It says "We the people of the Untied States of America"  not "We the people of the world". If you are a citizen of this country, our government's job is to ensure the rights set forth in that document.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was granted that right by birth. Whether or not he deserves it is not up for the government to decide. I'm still researching but as far as I understand, the only way you can revoke your birth-right citizenship in the U.S., other than filing for it, is to physically go to war for a foreign government against the U.S. Most of the stuff I've found online involves denaturalizing immigrants.</p>

<p>Let me remind everyone yet again, I don't support this Padilla character IF he was indeed planning (not actually doing) these things but if I want my birthrights to stay secure, I have to stand up for his.</p>

<p>Let the government play fair ball the way they've had to for 200 years and convict him in a U.S. court.</p>

<span class="title">Famous Quotes rock</span>

<p>I love this quote and it was mentioned again on Boston Public lastnight.</p>


<p><i>“Those who would trade freedom for security deserve neither.”</i></p>

<p>People are saying that the government is temporarily suspending our freedoms for security.</p>

<p>The government can't do that. Remember what the declaration of independance says. We were endowed by our creator with certain rights. Until the government  (and more so the people of the United States!) realize that they are only here to defend what our creator has given us and that they don't have the ability nor the right to take them away, we will not get it right.</p>

<p>Sorry about the disconnectedness of the rant but I had to get it out and I seriously needed a break from coding our Disk Imaging software fro the training room.</p>

<p>Back to work! hehe.</p>
