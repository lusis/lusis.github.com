<p>Here are a few links I've found from various sources. </p>


<p>I've decided to at least provide some links daily even if I can't entertain you with my witty banter. </p>

<p>By the way, does anyone OTHER than my family actually read this damn site? It's more of a personal journal for me than anything. Isn't that all blogs really are? A distributed forum? People respond to blogs from other sources all the time. <a href="nataliesolent.blogspot.com">Natalie Solent</a> comments on <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog">Samizdata</a> or <a href="http://www.instapundit.com">Instapundit</a>. <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> links to <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a> (although k5 would never link to a /. story ;>).</p>

<p>Blogging is like some sort of inbred family reunion. In the end, everyone is related to someone else.</p>

<p>Oh yeah....the links:<br />
<a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20030220-19499864.htm">Walter Williams gets it right</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/opinion/0203/20zell.html">Once again, Zell Miller says all the right things</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/20030220-11583742.htm">I knew something was up!</a></p>

<p><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">I finally decided to read Doc's weblog</a><br />
and he showed me <a href="http://blogstreet.com/visualneighborhood.html">this</a>. Too bad I'm not in there!</p>

<p>Speaking of Doc, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">LinuxJournal this month talks about blogs</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com/">The most interesting blog I've found recently.</a> It's a personal tips and tricks blog that, while geared to churches, is applicable to anyone with a website </p>
