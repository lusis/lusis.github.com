<span class="title">Shutup and Eat What we feed you!</span>

<p>[from the lusis.org archives]</p>


<p> I watch alot of tv. I mean hella amounts of tv. I even watch tv while Im working on the computer.</p>

<p>Thats not to say I watch more tv than I listen to music but none the less. So Im watching a spot of tv,</p>

<p>and a commercial comes on. At this point I cant even remember what the commercial was about.</p>

<p>(editors note: this entire post is going to be FILLED to the brim with dangling participles if only for the opportunity to stick the words dangling and participles together in a sentence)</p>

<p></p>

<p>So anyway back to the commercial. I have to freakin clue now what it was about but I do remember a few things.</p>

<p><br />
Number 1: It was a beautiful commercial in the esthetic sense of the word. Well crafted and probably cost a fuckton of money to produce.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Number 2: It was peaceful. When all was said and done, I was left with a vast sense of peace and completion. Stay with me, people. Ill get there real quick.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Number 3: For a brief moment, I would have bought a pile of dogshit from this company.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There is one thing in common with all comercials besides the shameless marketing of useless products that we will never use.</p>

<p>Music. Now most people know of my great love for music of all kinds (save a couple of flavors). Companies have been using music for years in the form of jingles.</p>

<p>How many people can still remember jingles that are 10 years old? Heres an example:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nuff said. Music is catchy. We all get songs in our heads that we cant seem to get out. They stick like poorly cooked pasta in the roofs of our minds.</p>

<p>Music engrains the lyrics into our heads. Thats how jingles work.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I just have a feeling that 5 years from now we will all be sitting at home with our families watching tv and a commercial will come on.</p>

<p>There will be no words, no voice overs...nothing. Just a single image of a bird on a tree branch or a a wave crashing on a beach.</p>

<p>Over the top of that image we will hear a steady stream of carefully crafted musical notes. At the end of 20 or 30 seconds, we will be sitting with our families</p>

<p>staring like a deer caught in headlights at our 50 inch wall panel tv wondering why we feel so incomplete. We will then get dressed in our brand new clothes,</p>

<p>pile into our brand new ford aerostar van and drive down to the local store en masse to purchase that brand spankin new, shiny toothbrush that we cant live without.</p>

<p>Well come back home to watch more tv and lather, rinse, repeat the entire process, becuase if we dont we will never feel complete, comfortable or at peace.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Dont feed the shit they feed you. Id go outside and stare at the sun right now but its too cold.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Maybe I should just go to the fridge, get another tasty beverage, call the local delivery place to order something on my fancy credit card and sit down and watch more television. </p>
