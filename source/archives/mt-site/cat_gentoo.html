<p>Problem: I need to run some commercial software on Gentoo that doesn't have an ebuild and comes in RPM format only.</p>


<p>Solution: <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=171234">This "Call to Arms" on the Gentoo Chat forums</a></p>

<p>The first ebuild is a modified version of  an ebuild that sandymac[at]gentoo.org did for the Tivoli Storage Manager Backup Client. His version was for 5.1.5. We have 5.2.2 running at our datacenter right now. The server runs on RHAS 3.0 and all of the clients, save three, are RedHat boxes. </p>

<p>The Gentoo clients are:</p>

<p>Firebird Database Server: for our Data Warehouse<br />
Cups Server A and Cups Server B: Handles all of the printing for our web application. (Our locations are not allowed to print things themselves only server initiated printing is allowed)</p>

<p>These three servers need client access to the TSM server for backups. My original thought was to use rsync to one of the redhat boxes and store the files there for backup but that wasn't elegent enough. It also adds one more step that could break along the way.  Considering I don't want to get a call from a junior admin at 4AM because he can't figure out how to restore the DW database or our printer pool, I'll use TSM and create nodes for the Gentoo servers.</p>

<p>I'm creating the entry here so I can provide a full tarball of a portage overlay. I'm also looking for more widespread commenting on the whole process.</p>

<p>You can get the tarball <a href="http://www.lusis.org/static/gentoo/tsm-ba.tar.gz">HERE</a></p>
