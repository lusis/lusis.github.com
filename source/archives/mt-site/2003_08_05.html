<p><a title="John's Ad Blocker" href="http://www.lusis.org/static/johnsadblock.xpi">Mozilla/Netscape7/Firebird adblocker</a> (right-click and save to desktop. Then open with Mozilla)</p>


<p>So I was playing around with <a href="http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/" title="Flash click-to-view">this package</a> because pulling the xml file over the internet was really dragging down flash pages. After installing I realized that it 1) overwrote my userContent.css and 2) wouldn't install to my user profile directory.</p>

<p>After googling a bit, I found out that 1) xpi files are just zip files and 2) making an app install in the user profile directory is as easy as changing 2 lines in the install.js.</p>

<p>That led me to package my userContent.css with Ted's click to view changes. The result is my nifty adblocker along with the flash click to view installed locally in the user profile directory.</p>

<p>The upshot is that I can easy install the app without having to navigate to the profile directory and all that.</p>

<p>Let me know if you use it. I might decide to play around with some mozilla plugins a bit more.</p>

<p>Edit: If anyone has any ideas as to why apache wants to serve this file as text, I'd appreciate it. I've added "AddType application/x-xpinstall .xpi" to my .htaccess but its not making any difference. Seems to only be happening on windows.</p>
