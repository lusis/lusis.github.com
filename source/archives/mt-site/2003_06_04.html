<p><a title="Weapons of mass destruction were never the real issue" href="http://www.ajc.com/print/content/epaper/editions/wednesday/opinion_e3ddf850e14eb1df00f6.html">Welcome to AJC!</a></p>


<p>Let me say this. Recently I've been feeling like I bought into some sort of lie. </p>

<p>I was the first to admit that I never felt threatened by Iraq. My thought was that I trusted Colin Powell more than the UN.</p>

<p>After all is said and done, I pick up a <a href="http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/index.html" title="website not really up to date">periodical</a> a few weeks ago at Barnes and Noble while getting a few study guides for the CCNA.</p>

<p>In this magazine, there was an article that disected the GWB speech before we went to war (the 48 hours speech). After various parts, the writer would add his commentary. He made some interesting points. Much of it centered around the LP policy of foriegn involvement. His point was that while Saddam was an asshole (my words) and deserved whatever came to him, the information regarding WOMDs was inaccurate and that even if it were valid, Iraq is a soveriegn state and that we had no right to attack them.</p>

<p>Let me make a few points. </p>

<p>I don't care how many people think that the 9-11 attackers came from Iraq. That proves nothing except the stupidity of the uneducated populace.</p>

<p>I don't care that some people are calling the war illegal. My interpretation is that the original UN resolution gave any member of the security council the right to enforce disarmament. I don't like the UN one bit but they did make the rule.</p>

<p>Things in the world are alot closer now.  Someone over in the middle east can pose a threat to our national security and not be on our shores. 9-11 itself proved that the definition of a threat has grown. </p>

<p>Either way, while Friedman (a writer who I love reading and usually agree with) says that he would have accepted that we had to attack Iraq for stability in the Middle East, I don't think I would have. I just wish I hadn't bought into the bull. I'm too smart for that.</p>
