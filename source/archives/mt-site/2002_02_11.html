<span class="title">Gotta love IBM</span>

<p>"Why would someone that good, play for nothing?"</p>


<p>"Because he loves the game. He loves the game"</p>

<p>Basically the commercial is a bunch of guys playing basketball. On each person's uniform is a name like "wireless" or "web" or "ecommerce".</p>

<p>The coach introduces the newest teamate "Linux" to the team. He procedes to pull a MJ (pre-Washington Wizards Jordon) and dunk all over the place. The quotes above are from a meeting that two guys are having about the new guy.</p>

<p>I have to tell you this is the best commercial for linux yet. "The Hiest" was cool and all but this really smacks it to the PHB's saying that something free can't be any good.</p>

<p>Rock on IBM!</p>
