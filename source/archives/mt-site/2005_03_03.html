<span class="title">Campaign Finance Act and Free Speech</span>

<p>I know it's been a while since I've posted but things have gotten to the point where I can again and I've found the perfect topic to rant about.</p>


<p>To everyone who voted FOR the Campaign Reform Act, thank you! To all of those who supported it, thank you! </p>

<p>In case you couldn't tell, that was sarcasm. I guess now anytime I write anything political or post a link to an LP website, I'll soon be in violation of Federal law.</p>

<p>When are people going to wake up and realize that the stupid laws they try and pass ALWAYS have unintended consequences? I want my elected officials to stop and think about that for about 2 minutes. Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>I'm going to post the links here at the end but the premise is this, Soft money contribution laws are soon about to apply to the Internet. It's going to apply to blogs. </p>

<p>Think about this. The Federal Government is now going to be able to supress free political speech on the Internet because it can be qualified as "soft money". You can read the questions that <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/">Declan McCullagh</a> poses to a FEC commissioner at <a href="http://news.com.com/The+coming+crackdown+on+blogging/2008-1028_3-5597079.html">C|Net</a> today.</p>

<p>Here's the last Q/A from the article which really sums up how scary this thing is:</p>

<p>"Q: So if you're using text that the campaign sends you, and you're reproducing it on your blog or forwarding it to a mailing list, you could be in trouble?</p>

<p>A: Yes. In fact, the regulations are very specific that reproducing a campaign's material is a reproduction for purpose of triggering the law. That'll count as an expenditure that counts against campaign finance law.</p>

<p>This is an incredible thicket. If someone else doesn't take action, for instance in Congress, we're running a real possibility of serious Internet regulation. It's going to be bizarre"</p>

<p>So thanks McCain and thanks Feingold! The world is a better place because of both of you!</p>
