<p> is whot bwings us here today.</p>


<p>So the wedding went off sans hitch. The weather for the rehearsal was much worse than that of the actual wedding. I've been waiting to post pictures and make the DVDs until we got the photos back from the photographer.</p>

<p>They actually came in this neat little cd-sized wedding album. All padded and what not!</p>

<p>I'm only going to post a few pics for now to give you an idea of the whole shebang. Lake Huron was AWESOME as a backdrop and many thanks to Wiltse's Brew Pub for a wonderful reception. If you ever make your way "Up North", stop by <a href="http://www.dine-oscoda.com/wiltses/">Wiltse's</a> and say have a Blue Ox Stout for me ;)</p>

<p>The honeymoon was great too. We drove up to Mackinac Island on Sunday after brunch with everyone. The B&B we stayed at was <a href="http://www.mackinacbayview.com/">The Bayview Bed And Breakfast</a>. It's right across from the Island House and not that far off the main street. We had a private balcony with its own entrance. Very Nice!</p>

<p>On Tuesday, we drove across the bridge and hung out in Da UP. There's a Best Western in Paridise, MI near <a href="http://www.exploringthenorth.com/tahqua/tahqua.html">Tahquamenon Falls</a>. Nice quiet respite from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning we went up to Whitefish Point to walk on the beach and see some birds before the 5+ hour drive to <a href="http://www.frankenmuth.org/">Frankenmuth</a>. We ate at <a href="http://www.zehnders.com/">Zehnder's</a> that night and flew back to Atlanta the next afternoon.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a short honeymoon but packed with lots of fun. We'll take a longer one when things settle down a bit. Maybe before we start the whole children thing?</p>

<p>So pictures will be coming soon! Until then, I'm uploading a few to give you an idea of how nice it was. I'll post the link later.</p>
