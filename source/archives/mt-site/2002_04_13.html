<span class="title">When mail servers go bad</span>

<p>Is it so hard to write an MTA that follows protocols?</p>


<p>This text is from a report on our company mailserver. I've cleaned it up a bit to remove some email addys. You would think that once my mailserver rejects the message, we would be done but NO. It seems some mailservers actually keep talking. I've gotten several of these lately. One report actually had the FULL spam, line by line.</p>

<p>Just plain crazy!</p>

<span class="title">Should I take the plunge or not?</span>

<p>I read a story about this Andrew W.K. bastard in a magazine.</p>


<p>I originally saw the first video one late night on mtvx. It came after a Mushroomhead video so I wasn't too concerned. It seemed like a fun sort of song. The only thing I left with was a desire to wash my hair and clean my face. I also got his stupid damn lyrics stuck in my head. Evidently Andrew WK wants us all to know that it's time to party hard! Then the other day I heard his newest single. Something RnB-ish about a girl being fine. It sounded EXACTLY like his other song. </p>

<p>Is the dickhead trying to pull an Everclear?</p>

<p>Oh well. I'm asking my (albeit small) viewing audience to share some things about this guy. He just seems so damn weird. I guess I'll have to AG the entire album just to decide if it's worth it.</p>
