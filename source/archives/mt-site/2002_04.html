<span class="title">Pictures are cool</span>

<p>I got a REALLY good deal on a Polaroid PDC 1300 at K-Mart's going-out-of-business sale.</p>


<p>It only cost me $86. </p>

<p>I know the battery life sucks but I don't really care. It does what I need it to do. I bought a SanDisk usb compact flash reader and it works WONDERFULLY.<br />
I've added a few pics to the gallery that you can check out.</p>

<span class="title">When mail servers go bad</span>

<p>Is it so hard to write an MTA that follows protocols?</p>


<p>This text is from a report on our company mailserver. I've cleaned it up a bit to remove some email addys. You would think that once my mailserver rejects the message, we would be done but NO. It seems some mailservers actually keep talking. I've gotten several of these lately. One report actually had the FULL spam, line by line.</p>

<p>Just plain crazy!</p>

<span class="title">Should I take the plunge or not?</span>

<p>I read a story about this Andrew W.K. bastard in a magazine.</p>


<p>I originally saw the first video one late night on mtvx. It came after a Mushroomhead video so I wasn't too concerned. It seemed like a fun sort of song. The only thing I left with was a desire to wash my hair and clean my face. I also got his stupid damn lyrics stuck in my head. Evidently Andrew WK wants us all to know that it's time to party hard! Then the other day I heard his newest single. Something RnB-ish about a girl being fine. It sounded EXACTLY like his other song. </p>

<p>Is the dickhead trying to pull an Everclear?</p>

<p>Oh well. I'm asking my (albeit small) viewing audience to share some things about this guy. He just seems so damn weird. I guess I'll have to AG the entire album just to decide if it's worth it.</p>

<span class="title">I love watching companies step over each other</span>

<p>To quote <i>"It's just absurd," said David Sifry, chief technology officer for Sputnik, a Wi-Fi network now in the building stages. He says the request is equivalent to asking them to "break the laws of physics" since it would require them to keep the stray emissions at a level equal to the amount of radiation emitted when water evaporates in sunlight. "It's that level of insanity you can't legislate." </i></p>


<p><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1033-877572.html">If our government can legislate morality, why not physics?</a></p>

<p>That was sarchasm.</p>

<span class="title">I've come to the conclusion</span>

<p>that IT managers continue to run Microsoft products in order to justify a large IT budget.</p>


<p>Smart money would tell you that the less money spent on IT infrastructure, is more value to your stock and possibly a bit more in your pocket. Despite all the bs going on my office, I still have this motivation to save the company money. </p>

<p>Will I ever see any of it?  Not likely.<br />
Do I care? Not really.</p>

<p>You wanna know what drives me to linux and unix? The fact that it makes it easier to get my job done. I don't like to have to babysit my servers. I like having the power to customize and optimize to my hearts content and getting things JUST right for the task. I like not having to worry about the BSA busting down my door when all I want to do is test an idea out. I hate that a company that has so much money as Microsoft just can't seem to get it right when it comes to security.</p>

<p>Look. I know that no OS is perfect and you really SHOULD use the best tool for the job. I won't deny that and I've come to accept that. I'm no zealot. I'm sure there are people who could make an OpenBSD install insecure. If you really can make a MS server secure, more power to you. My argument is that it takes more work and babysitting. </p>

<p>Babysitting is NOT the same as maintenance. Every server, linux - *bsd - ms - sun - hp -aix, all need maintenance. It's the nature of the IT beast. What I am saying is that the overall cost associated with running a linux or unix based server is less. I don't have hard numbers but I have experience with it. If you stick with open standards you can never go wrong. I'm sure a Notes server on linux would have just as many problems as on NT but if all you need is email, why aren't you just running IMAP and postfix? </p>

<p>I can't WAIT till some sort of open standards based group scheduling and calendaring takes off. That would really be the final nail in the exchange coffin. I can say with absolute certainty that is the ONLY reason we run exchange. Trust me. I did the investigation to migrate off of it when our last round of licensing came up.</p>

<p>I dunno. I guess it's this nasty pit I get in my stomach everytime I think about my email being stored in some proprietary edb file that I can't just open. I get frustrated when I fire up a machine that has windows installed and it becomes a pain in the ass to find out what processor it has in it. I don't give a fuck about the stepping and family. </p>

<p>Why can't I just 'cat  /proc/cpuinfo'?</p>

<p>You want to know what my problem with Microsoft in the server room is? I feel helpless. It seems to be a chore to find out anything. It seems to be a bitch to do ANYTHING remotely. VNC helps but it's not the same. I want to be able to 'tail -f /var/log/messages' and see in real time what's happening. I don't want to have to hit F5 in event viewer. I'm actually at home in a unix environment. Even after I passed my NT 3.51 tests, I never felt at home.</p>

<p>Here's the crux:</p>

<p> With unix and linux, I don't HAVE to take advantage of all the options if I don't want to but they are there if I need them.<br />
With Microsoft, I don't even have the options.</p>

<p>(fyi: the reason I didn't mention Novell is that I have almost NIL experience in that arena. I only discuss what I know. Or at least what I can bullshit my way through.)</p>

<p>I got this from monster.com (I really should just stop the job agent emails). Of note is the part about VNC integration with a web enabled application. What the hell is that all about? Custom workplace desktops via the web? Didn't the dot bombs already try this? Besides VNC is already integrated. It's called a java applet.</p>
