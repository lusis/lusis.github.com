<span class="title">Wow!</span>

<p>Been a while hasn't it?</p>


<p>Things have been hectic around the lusis household lately. Here they are in no uncertain order:</p>

<p>1) John gets a new job. It's a financial company about 2 miles down the road from my apartment.</p>

<p>2) Because of new job, John and Michelle resume househunting.</p>

<p>3) John and Michelle find the perfect home about 3 miles from the apartment. Still a long drive for Michelle but John can pick up and respond to emergencies surrounding kids (future kids that is!) in no time.</p>

<p>4) John and Michelle go under contract on perfect home.</p>

<p>5) John and Michelle will close on said home this Thursday and move in on Saturday!</p>

<p><br />
Things are going splendid in case you hadn't noticed. I'm going to be sending out an email to all my friends over tomorrow about the moving party ;) Free beer and pizza if you help move boxes. We have a moving truck coming to haul the big stuff (have you seen Michelle's desk or my couch?) but to keep things low-cost, we need people to help carry boxes up to the truck and then place them in the prearranged spot in the garage at the new house. Beer, soda and pizza will be served afterwards while the UofM/Ohio State game is broadcast in our new living room!</p>

<p>To those of you I haven't been able to keep in touch with, I apologize greatly. Things have been a whirlwind and won't slow down again till after the first of the year. We move in on Saturday and then the following Tuesday, we head out to Michigan for Thanksgiving. We'll have two whole days to enjoy our new home =P</p>

<p>Wish us luck and come help move boxes ;)</p>
