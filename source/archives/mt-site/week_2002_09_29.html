<span class="title">IP, Mickey Mouse and Alan Moore</span>

<p>I sent a link to my boss about the <a href="http://www.archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php">Internet Archive Bookmobile</a> (Click through if you don't know what it is).</p>


<p>He replyed back with his opinion as a comic book fan and provided <a href="http://161.58.84.234/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=2&t=000069 ">this</a> link. approaching IP from a capitalist and open-source point of view, I began to wonder why I was so opposed to IP so much. Could I reconcile the two?</p>

<p>I found quite a few links via google:<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=capitalism+%2B+intellectual+property&btnG=Google+Search">google results</a></p>

<p>One that stuck out most was <a href="http://www.ecommercebase.com/article/727">here</a>.</p>

<p>My conclusion was that perpetual intellectual property (such as espoused by the Sonny Bono copyright Act) actual hinders competition and encourages monopoly behaviour. The Framers understood ,rather clearly, this concept and provided for it in the Constitution:</p>

<p>"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."</p>

<p>Yes, you should be rewarded for your hard work but don't get lazy because the same rights that allowed you to get to this point are going to allow someone else to get there as well. Make the most of it because soon your idea becomes public domain so it can be expounded on and fuel competition in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The solution? </p>

<p>Make a better Mickey Mouse. </p>
