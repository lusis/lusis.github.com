<p>You've gotta love how unions want to get into the wallets of everyone.</p>

<p>I read about this website somewhere and decided to check it out. That's when I noticed the CWA logo at the bottom.</p>

<p>These guys have been trying to get at the tech community for years. There was a push during the boom orginally. Now it seems they are preying on the laid off tech staff in the U.S. and playing on xenophobia.</p>

<p>Let me make something clear. If someone wants to start a union, fine. It's your right as free individual to do so but I expect more from my fellow tech employees than that. We are all intelligent and hard working individuals who realize that what sets us apart from anyone else is our work. All the AFL-CIO and CWA wants is union dues. Why should someone who doesn't work as hard as you be rewarded the same as you are? If the CWA had its way, a network administrator wouldn't be able to make his own patch cable. That job would be reserved for a Cable Maker. Look at what unions did to Eastern Airlines. Spend your money making yourself more marketable and desireable to an employer, not lining the wallets of union reps. Your company will do better and so will you.</p>
