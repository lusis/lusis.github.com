<p>Well I'm changing the layout. I picked up the <a href="http://www.zeldman.com" title="Check out Zeldman&apos;s homepage">"orange book"</a> and just finished reading it. I didn't do anything till I got all the way through it.</p>

<p>I'm still getting a grasp on the xhtml nibblets (such as using ampersand codes instead of the standard character) but it's working out well. I&apos;m also learning quite a bit new information.</p>

<p>My goal is to have the site <a href="#footer" title="W3C validation links">validate</a> properly as well as be <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="It really makes you think">accessible</a>.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re running <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla Web Browser">mozilla</a>, I would HIGHLY suggest you get the <a href="http://placenamehere.com/pnhtoolbar/" title="Developer&apos;s toolbar">PNH Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>Not only will it allow you to disable all styles on a website to verify how the site will look to a different screen format (i.e. one that doesn't support stylesheets or uses its own layout - such as a phone) or screen reader, but it allows you to outline block elements so that you don&apos;t have to do stupid stuff like draw borders around all your box elements to see which is which.</p>

<p>Email me with any questions and PLEASE feel free to post comments with tips and tricks of your own.</p>

<p>I found this wonderful tidbit via <a href="http://nataliesolent.blogspot.com/2003_07_06_nataliesolent_archive.html#105753212650608636" title="Natalie Solent">Natalie Solent's blog</a>.</p>

<p>It's an amazing story from a Kenyan woman about globalization and how free markets lead to higher standards of living. </p>

<p>The best quote was this:</p>

<p><i>I was introduced formally to freedom and free market by reading books on freedom. The insights it offered were crystal clear. Presenting to me questions I had never contemplated before, such as what the proper role of government is, and the idea that protection of life, liberty and property were the only functions that could be justified in the existence of governments.</i><br />
