<p>I found this site from <a href="http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com/" title="EXCELLENT site">HYCW</a>, a site I check in on for design tips and commentary.</p>

<p>I've never actually bothered with photoblogs and never really considered them but the hunkabutta site (which seems to me to be a nice play on engrish) is just excellent.</p>

<p>The photos are brilliant .  Read and enjoy.</p>

<p>Actually I think it's been out for a while. I've been so busy that I didn't even know. 'Lucky You' is on the matrix reloaded soundtrack and that's what prompted me to hit deftones.com and see what was up.</p>

<p>I plan on buying the album here soon even if the some of the reviews are brutal. I've been warned not to expect "Adrenaline" or "Around The Fur" style material.</p>

<p>On another note, hit the videos section of deftones.com and watch the video for 'Minerva' and then watch 'Digital Bath'. I actually noticed this but it had been a while since I had seen Deftones live (hence watching the video for 'Digital Bath'), but has Chino gained some weight? I guess a few years off the road will do that. Not that it matters to me. Everyone knows I'm a big guy ;)</p>

<p>I just figured he got tired of looking like <a href="http://pics.heyoh.com/nye2k2/01080036.JPG" title="threedays">Ben Layer</a> with the ski goggles in the D.B. video.</p>
