<p>Well it seems like my site might just be shutting down soon.</p>


<p>It seems that my company will probably be shutting down in a week or so. This means I'll have to move hosting offsite somewhere inexpensive. Some people might say that I should not factor in hosting but I need a reliable email address and a place to host my resume as well as some other things (projects I'm working on that can relate to my resume). </p>

<p>Having said that, I don't know when the line will go dead but I'm working on part of that tonight (in addition to trolling monster.com!)</p>

<p>If I'm hosting a website for you, I can make a nice backup of everything you have and burn it to a cd (assuming you don't have everything backed up on your own side!).</p>

<p>And also, here's the tagline. If you know of any good companies in Atlanta or even Michigan and points in between looking for a high quality systems and network administrator, I'm available. I'll put my resume up shortly after I've updated it. I've been with this company for five years now and seeing as we did QA work, I got to play with ALOT of cool stuff. I've developed alot of neat stuff internally and handled an entire infrastucture move from one location to another by myself (and at one point sleeping under my yet-as-unfinished cubicle waiting on Qwest so things would be running by the time people came in).</p>

<p>I put alot into any company I work for and only expect that the company honors that work and respects me for it.</p>

<p>I'll keep the world updated! Or at least the world that reads my website ;)</p>
