<p>Michelle and I just finished a rousing game of "War Cribbage"<br />
</p>


<p>It&#8217;s fun too! Basically it started out one night when I whupped up on Michelle after dinner. I think it was my first double skunk. We started messing around with the cards and playing cribbage in the same style as war.</p>

<p>Tonight we refined the game to it's ultimate version - A DRINKING GAME!</p>

<p>Here's how it works. Each person needs a deck. For Christmas, along with my new Cribbage Board, I got a NICE twin pack of <a href="http://www.kem.com" title="Best Cards - EVER">Kem&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>You reset your pegs to start. Each person takes a deck and you start. It's not as fast paced as war but it's just as fun.</p>

<p>- Take turns flipping cards - War Style.<br />
- Any points scored during play (15s, runs, pairs), forces the looser to drink while the winner counts out the number of points.<br />
e.g. Michelle plays 6, I play 7, she plays an 8. I now have to drink while she counts to 3. She doesn&#8217;t want to count TOO slow because if I lay down a 5, it&#8217;s going to be the longest 4 seconds she's ever known ;)<br />
- 31 only counts for a point and only a quick drink is required. That also gives you a point on the board.<br />
- A bust ( going over 31 ) is also a point. As before, looser only has to take a quick swig on a single point.<br />
- After each hand (31 points or bust), the cards are moved off to your own side in case you need to recycle.<br />
- Nobs are a bit unique. It works this way:<br />
  Nobs are only awarded when a jack is played that matches the suit of the previously played card. Since each person has their own desk, It&#8217;s POSSIBLE to have each person after the first get nobs (A - Ace of clubs, B- Jack of clubs, C - Jack of clubs, D - Jack of clubs &lt;and 31 for 2 more points&gt;)<br />
- The game is over when one person gets 30 points ( on my board - an up/down not a race track style - that&#8217;s the top of the lane. )</p>

<p>If you have any questions, email me and I&#8217;ll be glad to explain the rules a bit better. If you come up with any variations or other similar games (war euchre for instance), I&#8217;ll be glad to post them.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Interesting article cowritten by the founder of <a href="http://www.cato.org" title="The Cato Institute">The Cato Institute</a> and its chairman. I&apos;m still digging for an interesting article that Michelle sent me about a sort of NeoCon cabal involving Wolfie, Cheney and a few others. I&apos;m now starting to agree with some people that Bush was handpicked because of his name and maliability to the whims of some extreme right-wing (god I hate phrases like that) politicals. </p>

<p>Make no mistake people, the Republicans are no more interested in limited Federal government than the Dems are.</p>

<p>You've gotta love how unions want to get into the wallets of everyone.</p>

<p>I read about this website somewhere and decided to check it out. That's when I noticed the CWA logo at the bottom.</p>

<p>These guys have been trying to get at the tech community for years. There was a push during the boom orginally. Now it seems they are preying on the laid off tech staff in the U.S. and playing on xenophobia.</p>

<p>Let me make something clear. If someone wants to start a union, fine. It's your right as free individual to do so but I expect more from my fellow tech employees than that. We are all intelligent and hard working individuals who realize that what sets us apart from anyone else is our work. All the AFL-CIO and CWA wants is union dues. Why should someone who doesn't work as hard as you be rewarded the same as you are? If the CWA had its way, a network administrator wouldn't be able to make his own patch cable. That job would be reserved for a Cable Maker. Look at what unions did to Eastern Airlines. Spend your money making yourself more marketable and desireable to an employer, not lining the wallets of union reps. Your company will do better and so will you.</p>
