We distort, you decide!</p>

<p>I think I'll go back to being sick over "Patriot II - Son of Ashcroft" now.</p>

<p>Many people are aware of the stink I've raised over Jose Padilla and Mike Hawash. I'm also an ardent opposer of the "Patriot II" act that the Bush administration is trying to get through right now.</p>

<p>I was NOT however aware of this issue. It seems that John Ashcroft and the rest of this administration will go to ANY length to violate the constitution in its pursuit of safety. This cannot happen. Don't think that because you are a Democrat or a Republican that this will be shot down. You MUST contact the relevent congresscritters and do something about this. Both Republicans and Democrats would LOVE to be able to stiffle free speech and freedom of association to suit a specific set of goals. Currently that pesky Constitution is standing in the way. If they can strip you of citizenship based on some arbitrary association or statement or action, then they won't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Note this section from the article closely<br />
<i>The law states that a person's intent to relinquish his or her citizenship can be inferred from conduct. Indeed, the same conduct that constitutes the "expatriating act" – for example, the act of funding the Chechen orphanage – could provide a sufficient basis for concluding that the person intended to give up his or her citizenship. Although the person would be able to try to challenge this determination in court, he or she would not necessarily succeed.</i></p>

<p>Take heed people, you need to stand up for your freedoms as citizens of this country.</p>
