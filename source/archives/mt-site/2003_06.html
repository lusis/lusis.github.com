<span class="title">War Cribbage</span>

<p>Michelle and I just finished a rousing game of "War Cribbage"<br />
</p>


<p>It&#8217;s fun too! Basically it started out one night when I whupped up on Michelle after dinner. I think it was my first double skunk. We started messing around with the cards and playing cribbage in the same style as war.</p>

<p>Tonight we refined the game to it's ultimate version - A DRINKING GAME!</p>

<p>Here's how it works. Each person needs a deck. For Christmas, along with my new Cribbage Board, I got a NICE twin pack of <a href="http://www.kem.com" title="Best Cards - EVER">Kem&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>You reset your pegs to start. Each person takes a deck and you start. It's not as fast paced as war but it's just as fun.</p>

<p>- Take turns flipping cards - War Style.<br />
- Any points scored during play (15s, runs, pairs), forces the looser to drink while the winner counts out the number of points.<br />
e.g. Michelle plays 6, I play 7, she plays an 8. I now have to drink while she counts to 3. She doesn&#8217;t want to count TOO slow because if I lay down a 5, it&#8217;s going to be the longest 4 seconds she's ever known ;)<br />
- 31 only counts for a point and only a quick drink is required. That also gives you a point on the board.<br />
- A bust ( going over 31 ) is also a point. As before, looser only has to take a quick swig on a single point.<br />
- After each hand (31 points or bust), the cards are moved off to your own side in case you need to recycle.<br />
- Nobs are a bit unique. It works this way:<br />
  Nobs are only awarded when a jack is played that matches the suit of the previously played card. Since each person has their own desk, It&#8217;s POSSIBLE to have each person after the first get nobs (A - Ace of clubs, B- Jack of clubs, C - Jack of clubs, D - Jack of clubs &lt;and 31 for 2 more points&gt;)<br />
- The game is over when one person gets 30 points ( on my board - an up/down not a race track style - that&#8217;s the top of the lane. )</p>

<p>If you have any questions, email me and I&#8217;ll be glad to explain the rules a bit better. If you come up with any variations or other similar games (war euchre for instance), I&#8217;ll be glad to post them.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Interesting article cowritten by the founder of <a href="http://www.cato.org" title="The Cato Institute">The Cato Institute</a> and its chairman. I&apos;m still digging for an interesting article that Michelle sent me about a sort of NeoCon cabal involving Wolfie, Cheney and a few others. I&apos;m now starting to agree with some people that Bush was handpicked because of his name and maliability to the whims of some extreme right-wing (god I hate phrases like that) politicals. </p>

<p>Make no mistake people, the Republicans are no more interested in limited Federal government than the Dems are.</p>

<p>You've gotta love how unions want to get into the wallets of everyone.</p>

<p>I read about this website somewhere and decided to check it out. That's when I noticed the CWA logo at the bottom.</p>

<p>These guys have been trying to get at the tech community for years. There was a push during the boom orginally. Now it seems they are preying on the laid off tech staff in the U.S. and playing on xenophobia.</p>

<p>Let me make something clear. If someone wants to start a union, fine. It's your right as free individual to do so but I expect more from my fellow tech employees than that. We are all intelligent and hard working individuals who realize that what sets us apart from anyone else is our work. All the AFL-CIO and CWA wants is union dues. Why should someone who doesn't work as hard as you be rewarded the same as you are? If the CWA had its way, a network administrator wouldn't be able to make his own patch cable. That job would be reserved for a Cable Maker. Look at what unions did to Eastern Airlines. Spend your money making yourself more marketable and desireable to an employer, not lining the wallets of union reps. Your company will do better and so will you.</p>

<span class="title">That's John "Mr. CCNA" Vincent to you!</span>

<p>Well I passed the CCNA.</p>


<p>Let me just tell you that the test is NOT easy. There is ALOT of stuff to know. It helps that I've been "doing" for the past 5+ years but it doesn't make it any easier.</p>

<p>I don't always remember commands off the top of my head and I have to occasionally look some things up.</p>

<p>Having said that, here are my tips for the CCNA.</p>

<p>1) Know subnetting like the back of your hand. I spent time to make sure I UNDERSTOOD it and then went back and made my own memorization charts. Know why the shortcuts work.</p>

<p>2) Routing is pretty important. I had more routing than switching questions.</p>

<p>3) Know subnetting.</p>

<p>4) Know IOS. The labs are not that easy. You have some access to "sh?" and "?" commands but you the labs are pretty involved. You don't want to waste time typing "encap?" "encapsulation ?" "encapsulation frame-relay ?" and on and on. The tab key DOES not work. Shortcuts such as "sh int e 0" are valid though. You aren't penalized for spelling mistakes either. I think the way the labs work are by comparing the configs left after you get done with one that is correct. </p>

<p>5) Know subnetting.</p>

<p>That's all I remember. Honestly. When I took my Microsoft tests, they weren't this hard (although I understand that they've gotten more real world and less regugitation). Even if you pass with a low score (hard to get since passing is 849/1000), you'll feel like you earned it. If you KNOW there are some areas that you feel like you performed not so well on, take a week off and then go back and read them after you pass the test. That is, if you feel like the CCNA is more than just a path to a higher paycheck. For me, it was a way to show employers that I know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, since I've been a network administrator for several years now, I just purchased the self-study guide for the 640-607 and the flash card kit. I'd also suggest getting a <a href="http://safari.informit.com" title="I love Safari">Safari Account</a>. Might I suggest you check out "Cisco® CCNA® Exam #640-607 Certification Guide" and print the "Foundation Summary" for each chapter. You can keep these around for the rest of your career as a quick ref. Also print out the Chapter 12 scenarios and black out the answers. Sit down and do them and then compare with the correct answers. These were probably the greatest help to me as it's a set of three scenarios that covers everything in a real world style example.</p>

<p>Good luck to anyone else taking it. If I get the job I've been working on, I plan on taking the <a href="http://www.extremenetworks.com/education/cert/ExtremeNetworksAssociate.asp" title="Extreme Networks">ENE</a> in several months. since they use Extreme stuff in-house.</p>

<p>Well it looks like I've been <a href="http://www.techtv.com/news/culture/story/0,24195,3415219,00.html" title="techtv.com">Joe Job'd.</a></p>


<p>Looks like someone snagged an email address from google groups and they're using it to send out a few viruses. It's also possible that the sender is someone who was already infected. Alot of newer viruses are using I.E. cache files to grab email addresses. I searched the groups myself and didn't find any reference to this email address posted by pine. This also leads to another caution. Pine likes to insert some random information in the headers for internal use.</p>

<p>There are patches for pine to fix this but for now I'm telling my mailserver to block ANYTHING that is addressed to PINE*@* with a message about the Joe Job.</p>

<p>Here's the original reject I got from w3.org. Notice that the destination address was random as well:</p>

<p>Okay so a few people know I like to play a game called <a href="http://www.uo.com" title="UO">Ultima Online</a>. Well I'm not going to go into too many details but check out the above link. If you play the game, you'll understand how funny it is (And you've probably read it already). If you play some other game, you'll still understand. If you don't play any game, just laugh at North Korea!</p>

<p><a title="Weapons of mass destruction were never the real issue" href="http://www.ajc.com/print/content/epaper/editions/wednesday/opinion_e3ddf850e14eb1df00f6.html">Welcome to AJC!</a></p>


<p>Let me say this. Recently I've been feeling like I bought into some sort of lie. </p>

<p>I was the first to admit that I never felt threatened by Iraq. My thought was that I trusted Colin Powell more than the UN.</p>

<p>After all is said and done, I pick up a <a href="http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/index.html" title="website not really up to date">periodical</a> a few weeks ago at Barnes and Noble while getting a few study guides for the CCNA.</p>

<p>In this magazine, there was an article that disected the GWB speech before we went to war (the 48 hours speech). After various parts, the writer would add his commentary. He made some interesting points. Much of it centered around the LP policy of foriegn involvement. His point was that while Saddam was an asshole (my words) and deserved whatever came to him, the information regarding WOMDs was inaccurate and that even if it were valid, Iraq is a soveriegn state and that we had no right to attack them.</p>

<p>Let me make a few points. </p>

<p>I don't care how many people think that the 9-11 attackers came from Iraq. That proves nothing except the stupidity of the uneducated populace.</p>

<p>I don't care that some people are calling the war illegal. My interpretation is that the original UN resolution gave any member of the security council the right to enforce disarmament. I don't like the UN one bit but they did make the rule.</p>

<p>Things in the world are alot closer now.  Someone over in the middle east can pose a threat to our national security and not be on our shores. 9-11 itself proved that the definition of a threat has grown. </p>

<p>Either way, while Friedman (a writer who I love reading and usually agree with) says that he would have accepted that we had to attack Iraq for stability in the Middle East, I don't think I would have. I just wish I hadn't bought into the bull. I'm too smart for that.</p>

<p>I found this site from <a href="http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com/" title="EXCELLENT site">HYCW</a>, a site I check in on for design tips and commentary.</p>

<p>I've never actually bothered with photoblogs and never really considered them but the hunkabutta site (which seems to me to be a nice play on engrish) is just excellent.</p>

<p>The photos are brilliant .  Read and enjoy.</p>

<p>Actually I think it's been out for a while. I've been so busy that I didn't even know. 'Lucky You' is on the matrix reloaded soundtrack and that's what prompted me to hit deftones.com and see what was up.</p>

<p>I plan on buying the album here soon even if the some of the reviews are brutal. I've been warned not to expect "Adrenaline" or "Around The Fur" style material.</p>

<p>On another note, hit the videos section of deftones.com and watch the video for 'Minerva' and then watch 'Digital Bath'. I actually noticed this but it had been a while since I had seen Deftones live (hence watching the video for 'Digital Bath'), but has Chino gained some weight? I guess a few years off the road will do that. Not that it matters to me. Everyone knows I'm a big guy ;)</p>

<p>I just figured he got tired of looking like <a href="http://pics.heyoh.com/nye2k2/01080036.JPG" title="threedays">Ben Layer</a> with the ski goggles in the D.B. video.</p>
