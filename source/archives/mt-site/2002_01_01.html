<span class="title">Happy New Year</span>

<p>Another year is upon us,</p>


<p>and I don't feel any different.</p>

<p>I went out to a cool new bar last night for a while. It's called Mazzy's. They have NICE 9 ft pool tables and serve food too. Pretty keen. </p>

<p>I met up with Ned there about 9:30 and we shot pool for about an hour or so while he updated me on all the random shit going on in his life. His divorce. His 2 yr. old daughter.</p>

<p>We left to go to Ben's party around 11ish. There were about 20 people there and we had a good old time. Ben had his mp3 server hooked up to his tv and a nifty little plugin going so all the people could sit and stare ;)</p>

<p>We watched the ball AND the peach drop on split screen. As usual the peach got there first. Champagne was passed around to all and I would gather about 8 or so bottles were finished off. </p>

<p>I didn't drink much myself because I didn't feel like getting wasted as bad as last year. I was more interested in catching up with some people (like Ben) I hadn't talked to in  a few years. </p>

<p>Got home about 2ish and called Michelle up at Almont. We talked for about 45 minutes and I proceded to fall asleep on the couch until the dog decided to wake me up. Guess I drank a bit more than I thought eh?</p>

<p>Happy New Year to all of you and good luck to those of you in Europe switching to the Euro. Maybe it won't be as big a clusterf*ck as everyone thinks it will be ;)</p>
