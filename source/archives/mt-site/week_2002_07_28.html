<span class="title">Blame Canada!</span>

<p>I found this link from an Ultima Online newsgroup.</p>


<p>It's about a guy named Gord who runs a video game store. Based on what people had said in the newsgroup, I figured it was a work of fiction but as they say, "Truth is stranger than fiction".</p>

<p>There's quite a bit of political commentary in there as well. I'm guessing that Gord isn't to happy with the nice socialist setup Canada has. </p>

<p>I wouldn't mind if someone from Canada could explain some of the legal things to me. I'm guessing that because Canada has such a strong welfare program, they give business the power they need to collect debts from credit risks? Or is this just standard business?</p>

<p>Anyway here's the link:<br />
