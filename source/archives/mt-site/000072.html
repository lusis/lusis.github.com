<a name="more"></a>
<p>One thing I've heard Neal Boortz say time and time again is that he guarantees that he values freedom more than you. I would say the same thing about myself.</p>

<p>Let me discuss some examples about my personal philosophy in terms of a hot topic issue...abortion.</p>

<p>I'm against abortion. I don't like the thought of it being used as a form of birth control. I don't like what it says about a society. It just doesn't sit well with me.</p>

<p>Having read that you may think, "You're against a woman's right to choose!".</p>

<p>You would be wrong.</p>

<p>Abortion is a moral issue. My feelings on the subject are based soley in my own moral founding. Because of that, I don't think that the government has any business saying what a person can do with her own body.</p>

<p>You see, I think that government has NO business in anyone's personal life. I don't feel that it is proper for a government to try and legislate morality. As long as a person's behaviour doesn't affect deprive me of life, liberty and personal property, the gubment has no business making a ruling one way or the other.</p>

<p>It is because of this alone that I am a libertarian. I value personal liberty above all else.  I cannot, in my heart and mind and soul, expect personal freedom, if I am not willing to extend that self same freedom to someone who shares a different belief system.</p>

<p>People often tell me that libertarian ideas are nice in theory but things that they propose have not been tested. I say hogwash. The principles of the LP and indeed and right-thinking freedom loving individual are the selfsame ideas that this country was founded on. </p>

<p>"How would our government survive without income tax?!?!?"<br />
- Read up on tax history. The country did just fine without it until the early part of the 1900's.</p>

<p>"Drugs are bad! They must be illegal!"<br />
- Yes drugs are bad. So is booze. We tried this with prohibition. Worked well didn't it? What trouble does it cause you if Bill decides to smoke a joint before bed? How does it deprive you of your life, your liberty or your own personal property. I'm not saying it shouldn't be regualted. In fact, I think it should be handled just like alchohol is handled today. DUI and all.</p>

<p>There is one quote from someone who I believe to be the most freedom-minded individual in history, Thomas Jefferson. It sums up everything I believe about freedom and government and politics. Readi t and think about it. You might actually be enlightened.</p>

<p><B>"The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."</B><i>--Thomas Jefferson</i><br />
