<p>ARIN has graced J.C. with a bigger block of IPs.</p>


<p>Of course being as gracious as they are, the old ones have to come back now.</p>

<p>I've updated all my services to listen on the new IP:</p>

<p>69.55.234.200 (fyi the old one was 65.200.24.200)</p>

<p>If you are seeing this message then you've got the right IP now and your DNS servers are updated.<br />

<span class="title">Ugh!</span>

<p>Okay I think I found the source of my apache problems.</p>


<p>It seems to be related to me getting over agressive in trying to optimize apache. I've upgraded all around and things should stay up now. I'm also trying to deal with the fallout of someone joejobbing my domain for the SCO virus. Add that in with Amavisd-new going nuts trying to scan all the incoming copies of the damn virus and my server is going nuts!</p>

<p>On a side note, I just got done with the first stages of setting up our new datacenter at work. An all Linux shop is serious fun. I'll be so glad when we get off this SilverStream crap.</p>

<p>Our setup as it stands is as follows:</p>

<p>(2) IBM x335 running Gentoo<br />
- these are our CUPS servers<br />
(3) IBM x335 running RHAS2.1<br />
- WAS5.1<br />
(1) IBM x335 running RHAS2.1<br />
- TSM 5.2<br />
(1) IBM x335 running nothing yet<br />
- This will be our DW server. Depending on which db we use, Gentoo or RHAS<br />
(2) IBM x445 running RHAS2.1<br />
- DB2 servers - 8 procs each, countless gigs of memory.</p>

<p>The DB servers are connected to a 500GB FasT600 via Brocade fiber switches.</p>

<p>I have to tell you that the Summit architecture that IBM has done is freakin' AWESOME!</p>

<p>It seems I forgot to change the mailserver setting when I copied my mt stuff over to the new server. </p>


<p>I've actually gotten comments and didn't even know it. Of course I've so busy on this webapp I've been creating that I haven't had time to do much else. That's fixed now. If you leave comments, I'll know and read them.</p>

<p>Michelle has been very supportive. I'm still with the company that was supposed to be closing up in June.  I knew I wouldn't be around after things finished so I've been happy to have any extra days (months even!). I really feel for the people who are going to be around afterwards  because of all the indetermination.</p>

<p>I also interviewed with a company that decided not to hire me because they though I was a windows guy. I'm still trying to figure out who they interviewed because it wasn't me.</p>

<p>FYI: new pictures:<br />
<a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/J-n-J-Wedding/" title="Jon and Jaime's wedding pictures">The Wedding (not mine!)</a></p>

<p>This is Michelle's brother and his new wife. The wedding was awesome and I got to takes notes (or was ordered to take notes =P). Since Michelle and I are getting married on the beach, some things didn't translate so well though. I was also a lector as well. </p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, you can see a picture of me and Michelle from  right before while we were getting ready.</p>

<p><a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/J-n-J-Wedding/aan" title="aww cute!">Michelle and I</a>. Get this, she caught the bouquet. I just sat there and said "She's the next to get married? No crap!"</p>

<p>Anyways, that's the status update. I'm going to go back to working on my small business software and drown myself in php.</p>

<p><a title="lusis.org" href="http://lusis.org/mt/lusis/bluechurch.html">Sample layout</a></p>


<p>Well I'm changing the layout. I picked up the <a href="http://www.zeldman.com" title="Check out Zeldman&apos;s homepage">"orange book"</a> and just finished reading it. I didn't do anything till I got all the way through it.</p>

<p>I'm still getting a grasp on the xhtml nibblets (such as using ampersand codes instead of the standard character) but it's working out well. I&apos;m also learning quite a bit new information.</p>

<p>My goal is to have the site <a href="#footer" title="W3C validation links">validate</a> properly as well as be <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="It really makes you think">accessible</a>.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re running <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla Web Browser">mozilla</a>, I would HIGHLY suggest you get the <a href="http://placenamehere.com/pnhtoolbar/" title="Developer&apos;s toolbar">PNH Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>Not only will it allow you to disable all styles on a website to verify how the site will look to a different screen format (i.e. one that doesn't support stylesheets or uses its own layout - such as a phone) or screen reader, but it allows you to outline block elements so that you don&apos;t have to do stupid stuff like draw borders around all your box elements to see which is which.</p>

<p>Email me with any questions and PLEASE feel free to post comments with tips and tricks of your own.</p>

<p>Well it looks like I've been <a href="http://www.techtv.com/news/culture/story/0,24195,3415219,00.html" title="techtv.com">Joe Job'd.</a></p>


<p>Looks like someone snagged an email address from google groups and they're using it to send out a few viruses. It's also possible that the sender is someone who was already infected. Alot of newer viruses are using I.E. cache files to grab email addresses. I searched the groups myself and didn't find any reference to this email address posted by pine. This also leads to another caution. Pine likes to insert some random information in the headers for internal use.</p>

<p>There are patches for pine to fix this but for now I'm telling my mailserver to block ANYTHING that is addressed to PINE*@* with a message about the Joe Job.</p>

<p>Here's the original reject I got from w3.org. Notice that the destination address was random as well:</p>

<p>And all is well with the world.</p>


<p>Especially since I've gotten everything moved over. If you notice any bugs or errors on my site, please let me know.</p>

<p>By the way <a href="http://www.johncompanies.com" title="Best webhosting ever">JohnCompanies</a> rocks me. I accidentally locked myself out of my server lastnight and shot an email over to reboot my instance and when I got up this morning, it was done.</p>

<p>If anyone is curious, my job hunt is going well. I'm still working for the QA Lab until they get everything moved over to corporate. I plan on bringing the old server home on Monday so I can ghost the drives and archive everything. After that, I'm turning it into a spare machine. Maybe a media server or something. I've got a spare tv out card here that I can stick into it. Besides, it has 2x20GB and 1x40GB in it. I can always use more disk space ;)<br />

<p>I like this!</p>


<p>I started futzing around with some various stylesheets. I really wanted to avoid tables as well.</p>

<p>I finally came across <a href="http://blogstyles.com/">BlogStyles</a>.</p>

<p>They had a three column layout that I liked alot. Since they were free for all, I took it and modified a few colors. I hope it's readable and loads nicely. My understanding and personal experience is that the only browser it DOESN'T load properly on is IE4.5 on Mac. </p>

<p>Anyone with a Mac has probably upgraded browsers by now anyway. Especially with Safari hanging around. I'll verify that it works okay when rendered with KHTML (which Safari uses) when I get home tonight.</p>

<p>It's all based in css so any browser that behaves should be able to read it.</p>

<p>Bother me if it doesn't work for you. I'd like to test it out myself</p>

<p>The gallery has been upgraded and templated in with the rest of the site.<br />

<p>Postnuke was overkill for what I was doing. I love php and I love Postnuke but I figured this would be a better solution.</p>

<p>I'm a tinkerer. Always have been. I once ruined a clockradio by taking it apart then cutting the ends off the plug and sticking the individual wires in the socket.</p>

<p>Turns out a fuse had blown but I was only 9 so I had no clue. More fuses were blown after I was done with it.</p>

<p>I'll be migrating the stories over as soon as I can. Blogging is such a bad habit! And a bad word for that matter.</p>

<p>What this means for people with sites hosted here is this:</p>

<p>php is now at 4.2.3 and register_globals is now OFF.</p>

<p>If this breaks a script you have, you'll need to fix it.</p>

<p>Any questions?</p>

<span class="title">Recent downtime</span>

<p>Well you might have noticed that the site was down for a while over the holiday weekend. Let me explain what happened as much as possible.</p>


<p>I got a call from my boss Friday afternoon around 2:30. It seems he couldn't get to our marketing website. I checked some things from the house and sure enough we were down hard. </p>

<p>My next step is to call the office and see if it was just the internet circuit or all three t's.</p>

<p>Fast busy.</p>

<p>I started fearing the worst. We have issues with power in our area. It's not uncommon for us to have brownouts in the middle of the day. I figured we had an extended power outage and the UPS's died. </p>

<p>Since I have 45 minute drive to the office, I kept trying to call every so often. I also was wondering if the alarms were out if the power had been off this long. Still busy.</p>

<p>I get to the office and see we have power. I pick up handset and try to dial out. No free lines.</p>

<p>I headed into the phone room and see that all three smart jacks are dead. No lights. Nothing.</p>

<p>I call Qwest and MCI and figure whoever gets to bellsouth the fastest will be my hero. </p>

<p>After playing about all of the cribbage I could play whilst working with our providers, I decide to grab a laptop and hook it up to a POTS line to browse the web.</p>

<p>No dial tone?</p>

<p>I then check the fax machines and realize that I can't get anything. Time to call Bellsouth business services directly on those lines. Turns out they have ""a cable problem"".</p>

<p>I call back our providers and explain to them what info I got from Bellsouth. I tell them I'm going home and I'll wait for Bellsouth to contact me.</p>

<p>That's when it gets good.</p>

<p>As I'm leaving the office, I see 3 bellsouth trucks down by the box. I'm an amicable guy so I wanted to go apologize for having them rush out when I didn't realize it was a larger problem. As I walk up and shout hello, I notice three of the saddest and most pissed off guys on the planet. I explain who I am and then they decide to show me the  phone box.</p>

<p>It's in tatters. Wires are everywhere. I can't say much other than that on the issue because there's an active police involvement but this was some nasty stuff. Let's leave it with this. There were 1200 pairs in that box. Not one was left.</p>

<p>So as you can see, this wasn't something lame like hardware failure whilst I was out of town. It was much more serious and I apologise to everyone involved.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lusis.org/ca.crt"> My Certficate Authority root certificate</a> - All ssl services (https, imaps, webmin) will be signed by this CA.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lusis.org/ca.crl">My Certificate Authority Revocation List</a> - All revocations are in this list and it's update every 7 days. This will be more important when I start issuing user certificates.</p>

<p>Many of the things I will be implementing <br />
The following services are being disabled with no chance for reactivation:</p>

<p>-ftp<br />
-telnet</p>

<p>The following changes are up for discussion on a per user basis:</p>

<p>- imap<br />
- pop3</p>

<p><br />
My preference on those two is to move to imaps and spop. Fetchmail and other common mail clients now fully support digital certificates. For those not in the know, certificates are what you use when connecting to a site via ssl (https:// in the url bar). </p>

<p>There are now plenty of freeware and opensource tools along with the standard commercial tools for connecting securely to a host on the internet. </p>

<p>Besides using other options, you can easily build an encrypted tunnel to lusis.org using ssh. As with the others, there are freeware,opensource and commercial products available to do this.</p>

<p><b>The List</b></p>

<p>I'm going to run down a list of tools I use at home and work to connect securely to lusis.org at all times. This not only includes digital certificates but creating ssh tunnels as well. For each product listed, the license is in parentheses next to the name.</p>

<p>1) SecureCRT (commercial) - <a href="http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/index.html">VanDyke</a><br />
If you're stuck in Windows world, this is THE commercial package for terminal connections. It supports ssh1/ssh2, telnet, rlogin, serial and tapi protocols. The company I work for owns a few SecureCRT licenses for me. You can connect securely to lusis.org as well as build ssh-based vpn tunnels.</p>

<p>2) Entunnel (commercial) - <a href="http://www.vandyke.com/products/entunnel/index.html">VanDyke</a></p>

<p>This is a new product from VanDyke. We recieved a free license for it by being SecureCRT subscribers (now THAT'S how you show your customers you appreciate them). It's basically a tunnel-only version of SecureCRT. The interface is easy to understand and it sits happily in the system tray letting you know it's doing its job. It's much cheaper than SecureCRT as well. I currently use this at work to create a tunnel for IMAP and SMTP to lusis.org so I can securly read mail at work. If you can afford it, I suggest you get this! You can create a tunnel for all of your commonly used services such as imap,pop3 and smtp quick and easy.</p>

<p>3) OpenSSH (Open Source) - Any linux/bsd distribution on the planet!</p>

<p>This is what I use at home. There are windows ports as well using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">CygWin</a> but I don't run Windows at home so I don't care. I used the Windows version at work until we got the free license for Entunnel.</p>

<p>Basically ssh has the functionality included to create tunnels. An example would be:</p>

<pre>
ssh -f -L25:godspeed.lusis.org:25 -L143:godspeed.lusis.org:143 -l username godspeed.lusis.org  'tail -f logfile'
</pre>

<p>This will forward all connections to your local machine on ports 143 (IMAP) and 25 (SMTP) to the server godspeed.lusis.org (that's us!)</p>

<p>This way, you would set up your mail client to user localhost for the incoming and outgoing servers. That's it! Easy as pie. </p>

<p>The part at the end is the command you want to execute on the remote server. I like to run this in a transparent window under X so I can see my remote webserver logfiles.  </p>

<p>I also use HostKey authentication on lusis.org.</p>

<p>When I log into X at home, gnome-ssh-askpass pops up and asks me for my passphrase. I enter it and my entire X session has access to lusis.org without a password.  Knowing the passwords *I* choose, I'd rather type a really secure and long passphrase once than typing the password over and over since it's equally long and complicated.</p>

<p>I'll be creating some howto's on this (allthough there are plenty on the web) in the method that works best for me.</p>

<p>4)  Winscp2 (freeware) - <a href="http://winscp.vse.cz/eng/">WinSCP2</a></p>

<p>I was at work one day and someone needed access to my server to upload some files. Consider I have ftp restricted on lusis, and didn't want to change it, I took the long approach and hit google. This is what I came up with. It presents a nice two-pane file view of a remote host using ssh and scp. If you use something OTHER than MS FrontPage (Hi Mike!) to create your sites, then this is the way to go when you need to upload the pages. Pretty standard stuff. It's like most other ftp clients on the market.</p>

<p>5) gftp (Open Source) - <a href="http://www.gftp.org">gftp.org</a></p>

<p>If you want a gui under *nix similar to winscp2, then gftp is for you. It's a gtk based ftp client that not only supports ftp and http but ssh transfers as well. I think it's included by default in gnome-desktop.</p>

<p>6) webmin (Open Source) - <a href="http://www.webmin.com">Webmin</a></p>

<p>I saw this on the desktop of a diehard NT guy who I was helping learn linux. I had NEVER heard of the project (kept my head buried in the command line I guess). Every since then, I've installed it on all the servers at the office and on lusis.org as well. The main reason I mention it is that i've got a webmin group that all users are in that give them access to the basics of thier accounts: file manager, ssh client, change password, scheduled tasks. The filemanager and ssh tools are java based. The other two are html based. With those four tools, you can upload files to your webpage, edit files directly on the server, change your password and create any cron jobs you need for your site (such as syndication or pulling weather - Tomislav included ;> ).</p>

<p>It operates under https and uses a non-standard port that may or may not be open on your firewall if you need to get to it from, say, work. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I've got a few other options as well that I've either implemented or have thought about.<br />
1) Secure webmail -<br />
I've had <a href="twig.screwdriver.net">Twig</a> setup in the past. I got frustrated with it because each consecutive upgrade would wipe the database. I don't think that's the case anymore but there are other options as well. Squirellmail and Imp come to mind. </p>

<p>Pros - access email from ANYWHERE that has a web browser.<br />
Cons - Dedicated IP address required for ssl.</p>

<p>2) Webdav - search google</p>

<p>I did a test with this and it left a sour taste in my mouth. It's probably me but it just didn't feel secure. Sure you can wrap it in ssl but I didn't like that I would have to give an IP address to each site that needed webdav access. It also didn't have any real authentication built in. If things have changed, I'd look at it again but for now I'm going to let it slide. There are other ways to do things.</p>

<p>3) User certificates - </p>

<p>I'm thinking about issuing these for people when it comes to using webmin and webmail.  I already use one for the admin account to webmin. Seems the most secure to me. I'll take any emails from detractors though.</p>

<p>That leads me to the final point. If anyone has any comments about personal experiences with any of the things I've discussed, I'd be glad to hear them. If you use any of the services on lusis.org, let me know as well how it might impact you. Maybe we can reach a workaround.</p>

<p>Hope this provides some interesting information and look for some tools (shell scripts, delphi applications, tutorials) that I'll be creating to do some of these things.</p>

<span class="title">Postfix is now running</span>

<p>I finally got postfix all configured.</p>


<p>I've got the rules pretty tight on what can and can't get through. If you get any information about mail getting rejected for whatever reason, forward it to postmaster at lusis.org.</p>

<p>I've stopped short of subscribing to an RBL list. I want to see how much spam I can block by stopping things like servers that don't have a valid HELO client name or whatnot. Again if anyone who has an email account on the server is having problems, just drop me a line.  I'll also accept sample configs from various people that might have example access files and main.cf's that have been succesful in blocking the majority of UCE. I'll be glad to post them here for others to download as well.<br />
