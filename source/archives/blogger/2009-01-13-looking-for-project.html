So to speak.<br /><br />As I sit and watch the AWS emails come in about this new thing and that, I find myself trying to think of a "project" of sorts to really have more fun with the latest AWS offerings. Nothing is really coming to mind.<br /><br />I'm not trying to create the next Twitter or anything. I just want to keep abreast of the latest technology. One thing I can say about RBX was that we were willing to "try" things if it made sense. I had an immensely fun time working on the Elf Island proposal to use EC2 and S3. Amazon has done a lot in the past year to address my biggest concerns with things. The addition of the management console is just awesome and makes me want to poke at it a bit more.<br /><br />It's possible that I might move my various family galleries over to S3 backed storage. I'm looking at doing some WoW related stuff as well.<br /><br />Who knows.<br /><br />Maybe I'll go ahead and do that hosted Nagios thing I've been wanting to do for so long.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-2909101920475136769?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
