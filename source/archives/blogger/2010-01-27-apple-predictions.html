I wanted to get some quick predictions out for the Apple event today in the event that the device is a tablet:<br /><br />- WiFi<br />- Bluetooth<br />- WhisperNet (like Kindle) via Verizon or possibly Clearwire/Sprint (and thus be carrier independent when LTE is rolled out across the board.)<br />- Wireless HDMI (aka WiDi)<br />- Wireless Charging<br /><br />I don't think the device will have ANY external ports whatsoever. Depending on the range of WiDi, you can sit on your couch and broadcast a iTunes show to the TV while doing other stuff on the tablet itself. If you want, you leave the charging pad by the television or somewhere else.<br /><br />Imagine you're riding on the train watching the latest episode of whatever. You get home and the device picks up where it left off broadcasting to your television.<br /><br />I think social gaming a la Farmville will be there as well. Garage band on this thing would actually be pretty cool.<br /><br />Anyway, some of these ideas are my own and others are things I've picked up from various podcasts but if I were building the next gen "device", those are the features I would pick.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-1470565792685869891?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
