<blockquote>"I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer"</blockquote><br /><br />So basically, I'm lending money to the banks so that they can charge me interest to lend it BACK to me? What kind of idiocy is that? Why not let me just put the money in my OWN favorite interest bearing instrument?<br /><br />We're doomed.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-2522431754511503607?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
