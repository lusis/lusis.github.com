Okay that's a silly title but that's what I'm doing.<br /><br />I need to keep my skills up. I'm taking "commissions" for any Nagios plugins people might want written. I'll try and keep the dependencies to a minimum. Language will be anything from Perl to Ruby or possible a Bash script.<br /><br />What I need from you:<br />- What service you want monitored.<br />- What information from the service you want monitored.<br />- If it's a commercial application, I'll need a trial version that works on a platform I have access to.<br /><br />So if you want a plugin for monitoring MyCommericalERP package that only runs on AIX, I'm probably not going to be able to do it. I have an old RS6000 here and that's about it. I would gladly let you give me a Power system though if you wanted ;)<br /><br />However if you use MyOpensourceERP that runs on Linux then there's a good chance I can come up with something.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-5532247876756929317?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
