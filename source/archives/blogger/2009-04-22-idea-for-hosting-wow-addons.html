So this curse/wowi/wowmatrix thing has gotten a bit out of hand. It's pitting technical people (addon authors, site administrators) against non-technical users (addon consumers).<br /><br />The one thing that people don't get is the cost of bandwidth involved. I think I've come up with a way for that might satisfy everyone.<br /><br />I want to build an addon hosting infrastructure built entirely on Amazon AWS. Here's sort of what I envision:<br /><br />- EC2 for hosting a web frontend/gateway to the site.<br />- All the addons are hosted on S3<br />- People must have an S3 account to access the addons<br />- Billing is done to the downloader's S3 account<br />- Alternately, you could use devpay<br /><br /><br />Then we would see how much people think bandwidth is "free"<br /><br />I need to flesh it out more and actually "design" it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-709179880045522199?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
