This is just a quick list of some of my more active projects:

## [Noah](https://github.com/lusis/noah)
A RESTish service inspired by Apache ZooKeeper using URI patterned asynchronous callback for Watchers

## [Monitoring Sucks](https://github.com/monitoringsucks)
Taking a crack at organizing a bunch of smart folks to rethink how we do monitoring from collection all the way through to alerting and visualization.

## Chef cookbooks
I have two repositories for cookbooks. Originally they were under my account but I created a GH organization to house them. This allows people to use them easier with the `knife` github plugin.

### Original repositories
[lusis](https://github.com/lusis/lusis-cookbooks)

### New repositories
[lusis-cookbooks](https://github.com/lusis-cookbooks)

## [Vogeler](https://github.com/lusis/vogeler)
A project I created while learning Python for my previous employer. Essentially a framework for command and control inspired by MCollective
