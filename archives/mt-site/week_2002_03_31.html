<span class="title">I've come to the conclusion</span>

<p>that IT managers continue to run Microsoft products in order to justify a large IT budget.</p>


<p>Smart money would tell you that the less money spent on IT infrastructure, is more value to your stock and possibly a bit more in your pocket. Despite all the bs going on my office, I still have this motivation to save the company money. </p>

<p>Will I ever see any of it?  Not likely.<br />
Do I care? Not really.</p>

<p>You wanna know what drives me to linux and unix? The fact that it makes it easier to get my job done. I don't like to have to babysit my servers. I like having the power to customize and optimize to my hearts content and getting things JUST right for the task. I like not having to worry about the BSA busting down my door when all I want to do is test an idea out. I hate that a company that has so much money as Microsoft just can't seem to get it right when it comes to security.</p>

<p>Look. I know that no OS is perfect and you really SHOULD use the best tool for the job. I won't deny that and I've come to accept that. I'm no zealot. I'm sure there are people who could make an OpenBSD install insecure. If you really can make a MS server secure, more power to you. My argument is that it takes more work and babysitting. </p>

<p>Babysitting is NOT the same as maintenance. Every server, linux - *bsd - ms - sun - hp -aix, all need maintenance. It's the nature of the IT beast. What I am saying is that the overall cost associated with running a linux or unix based server is less. I don't have hard numbers but I have experience with it. If you stick with open standards you can never go wrong. I'm sure a Notes server on linux would have just as many problems as on NT but if all you need is email, why aren't you just running IMAP and postfix? </p>

<p>I can't WAIT till some sort of open standards based group scheduling and calendaring takes off. That would really be the final nail in the exchange coffin. I can say with absolute certainty that is the ONLY reason we run exchange. Trust me. I did the investigation to migrate off of it when our last round of licensing came up.</p>

<p>I dunno. I guess it's this nasty pit I get in my stomach everytime I think about my email being stored in some proprietary edb file that I can't just open. I get frustrated when I fire up a machine that has windows installed and it becomes a pain in the ass to find out what processor it has in it. I don't give a fuck about the stepping and family. </p>

<p>Why can't I just 'cat  /proc/cpuinfo'?</p>

<p>You want to know what my problem with Microsoft in the server room is? I feel helpless. It seems to be a chore to find out anything. It seems to be a bitch to do ANYTHING remotely. VNC helps but it's not the same. I want to be able to 'tail -f /var/log/messages' and see in real time what's happening. I don't want to have to hit F5 in event viewer. I'm actually at home in a unix environment. Even after I passed my NT 3.51 tests, I never felt at home.</p>

<p>Here's the crux:</p>

<p> With unix and linux, I don't HAVE to take advantage of all the options if I don't want to but they are there if I need them.<br />
With Microsoft, I don't even have the options.</p>

<p>(fyi: the reason I didn't mention Novell is that I have almost NIL experience in that arena. I only discuss what I know. Or at least what I can bullshit my way through.)</p>

<span class="title">Wonder what these guys are developing?</span>

<p>I got this from monster.com (I really should just stop the job agent emails). Of note is the part about VNC integration with a web enabled application. What the hell is that all about? Custom workplace desktops via the web? Didn't the dot bombs already try this? Besides VNC is already integrated. It's called a java applet.</p>
