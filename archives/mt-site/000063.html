<p>Jose Padilla gets to see his lawyers!</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>Now before I go any further, let me say that i think the guy is scum. I think he is useless and that I hope he gets the full force of the law brought against him.</p>

<p>Some of you may not remember. I'm guessing the Bush Administration and the Ashcroft Regime was happy if that's the case.</p>

<p>An American citizen was being held illegally by the military. He was denied Due Process and all his rights were stripped.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that. </p>

<p>And American citizen. Just like you and just like me. Not someone in the States on a Visa. Nothing at all like that. Mind you he's a criminal with a gang record, but he is still a citizen and by the U.S. Constitution, entitled to certain rights as such.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was detained by the government for having SUSPECTED ties to Al Qaeda. They said he MIGHT have been involved in a plot to detonate a dirty bomb.</p>

<p>Let's cut through all the emotional rhetoric and get down to what this really is.</p>

<p>Despite his ties, if any, to Al Qaeda, this was a citizen of this country who was arrested for his thoughts.</p>

<p>Thoughtcrime.</p>

<p>The government claimed he was an "enemy combatant" and therefore his rights were out the window. </p>

<p>Jose Padilla didn't rise up and take arms against the U.S. He was arrested on a material witness warrant and secretly held in a government prison.</p>

<p>This vague "enemy combatant" crap has to go. He didn't DO anything. The government had to nothing but label him and he looses all his rights? I don't remember reading that part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>As bad as some people think it sounds, there are different rules for citizens and non-citizens. If you want the protection of the Constitution of the United States, only one thing is asked in return. That is to be a citizen of the United States. It says "We the people of the Untied States of America"  not "We the people of the world". If you are a citizen of this country, our government's job is to ensure the rights set forth in that document.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was granted that right by birth. Whether or not he deserves it is not up for the government to decide. I'm still researching but as far as I understand, the only way you can revoke your birth-right citizenship in the U.S., other than filing for it, is to physically go to war for a foreign government against the U.S. Most of the stuff I've found online involves denaturalizing immigrants.</p>

<p>Let me remind everyone yet again, I don't support this Padilla character IF he was indeed planning (not actually doing) these things but if I want my birthrights to stay secure, I have to stand up for his.</p>

<p>Let the government play fair ball the way they've had to for 200 years and convict him in a U.S. court.</p>
