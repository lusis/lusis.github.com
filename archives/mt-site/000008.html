<span class="title">Michigan</span>

<p>Well I got back from Michigan last night and boy do I have tales to tell!!!</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>Actually nothing so exciting except my a few troubles at the airport. Here's the scoop.</p>

<p>I got to the Marta station at 2:00. I got on the train and settled in for the 40 minute ride to the airport. I'm feeling all cool and stuff, wearing a neat new black combo outfit I bought for the trip (since I knew it would be cold, I bought a few long sleeved shirts). hell, even my underwear were black!</p>

<p><br />
The line at the Airtran counter was nice and short. I get up to the counter and answer all the questions. As I'm closing up my bag, the man at the counter informs me that my license is expired.</p>

<p><br />
runthatbymeonemoretime?</p>

<p><br />
It turns out when I reactivated my license at the begining of the year, they didn't renew it at the same time. It expired on my birthday. I could feel my stomach hit my knees. He told me that he would have let me go sign in but with all the strictness and the fact that people (poorly paid I might add) with guns would be checking it a second time as I went through the metal detectors to the gates, it would be stupid.</p>

<p><br />
I kindly asked him what time the next flight was while I ran down my options in my head.</p>

<p><br />
My passport was at home. It should still be valid from last summer (I think they're good for 3 years). I'll get a cab home and try and get back in time. I run out to the cab stand and explain to the manager my situation. He called a cabbie over and told me they could get me up to Northridge and back for $100. I swallowed hard and said ok. Mind you I've paid the cab fair to the airport from home before and one way was about 60 bucks at the time. I figured I was getting off easy. We get in the cab and take off. As we pull out of the airport, the cabbie says that he can take me somewhere to get a license and would do it for 50 bucks.</p>

<p><br />
The next words out of my mouth were "Is it legal?". I had visions of getting stranded in College Park at some low-rent apartment complex with my laptop bag in hand and a gun to my head. He said there was a license station at a Kroger nearby. I told him to do it and off we went.</p>

<p><br />
I was back at the airport in 30 minutes. Considering there was a chance that we wouldn't make it back in time if we had gone all the way north, I felt lucky. I pulled 50 bucks out of the ATM at the Kroger and paid him in cash with no meter.</p>

<p><br />
I went back to the Airtran line which oddly enough was now wrapped around the terminal.<br />
an hour later I was on my way to the gate. I plugged in my headphones when I got on the plane and slept.</p>

<p><br />
We landed in Flint and Michelle met me outside the security checkpoint. We stepped outside and my jewels jumped up in my stomach. Cold as hell.</p>

<p><br />
We had venison keebabs and various other things for dinner. Her mom, dad , brother and brother's girlfriend were really cool.</p>

<p><br />
Her dad(Mike) is a general purpose lawyer and he mom(Virginia) is a teacher.</p>

<p><br />
Jon(her brother) is back in school to be a lawyer after getting a degree in Archaeology. Jamie (girlfriend) is a nurse.</p>

<p><br />
The next morning we went to a local Saginaw joint called Tony's. It's like waffle house with more grease.</p>

<p><br />
Let me inform you of my ONE gripe with the north (other than the curse of god known as the Michigan D.O.T). Sweet tea does not exist. I thought about (and bitched about) this the entire weekend. Who in the hell would drink tea WITHOUT sugar unless they were dieting?</p>

<p><br />
They kept telling me to just add sugar but I explained to them that sugar doesn't dissolve properly in cold water. It has to be added to a fresh brew.</p>

<p><br />
God bless 'em the poor bastards ;)</p>

<p><br />
Friday morning Michelle and I drove back to Allegan, where she lives. It's a small town and freaking beautiful to boot.</p>

<p>We got up Saturday morning and went for breakfast at the single most pink diner I've ever seen. Everything was painted pink. We decided to walk around town and do some shopping for some things to bring everyone back home. I needed to stop by an ATM first though.</p>

<p><br />
........</p>

<p><br />
Uhhhh where the hell is my Visa/ATM card? I emptied my wallet right there and couldn't find it. We went back to her house and a dug through my luggage and laptop case. No luck. Best guess is that I left it IN the ATM machine at Kroger when i got money out for Adam the cabbie. I called and canceled it and sulked. Jon and Jamie had arrived while we were at lunch. We sat around and watched football (Michigan v. West Michigan/Notre Dame vs. Michigan State) all afternoon. My best guess is that this is a religious event. I actually enjoyed it.</p>

<p><br />
After all the games, we went down to the party store (no, not hats and whistles..a liquor store) and stocked up on some things. We went back to Michelle's and sat on the porch drinking and talking. A good time was had by all.</p>

<p><br />
(Side note: I'm still shocked that as we stopped at a 7-11, I was able to look behind the counter and see a big bottle of Captain Morgan's rum. Evidently, all the convienence stores there have liquor licenses or the restrictions are alot less harsh on selling liquor)</p>

<p><br />
Jon and Jamie stayed the night and left the next morning. Since it was raining all day, Michelle and I cuddled up on the futon and watched Quantum Leap re-runs on scifi (god what geeks we are). It cleared up by the time the final episode ran so we went for a walk down to the store and took a loop around through the graveyard in town. This thing was AMAZING. I started feeling a little sick so we headed back home. It turned out to be a overnight bug (possibly caused by the drastic change in weather?) and I was feeling good by next morning. We slept until noon and then I packed up. We went to get some lunch and stopped by an orchard on the way out of town to get some fruit for the road. Next time I come up i'm going to use my well guarded Visa card to by some stuff for the family and bring back. Of special note is the fresh apple cider and michigan honey (flower and sweet varieties no less!).</p>

<p><br />
Things were kind of quiet on the drive to Flint (2:45 hours from Allegan). We sat at the airport and read through Maxim together while we waited for my flight to be called. When it was, we walked to the gate together and I kissed her goodbye.</p>

<p><br />
It sucked. I didn't want to leave but I needed to get back to work. (I kept hoping a sudden snowstorm would hit and I would get stuck for a few more days ;> )</p>

<p><br />
The flight home was boring. The train ride home was boring. The drive home was boring.</p>

<p><br />
i'm already planning my next trip up in December ;) </p>
