<p><a title="Poor Republicans" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/21/santorum.gays.ap/index.html">CNN.com - Gay groups criticize Santorum remarks as insensitive - Apr. 21, 2003</a></p>

<p><br />
</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>Quoth Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p><i>"If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual (gay) sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything"</i></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><i>"All of those things are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family," Santorum said. "And that's sort of where we are in today's world, unfortunately. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn't exist, in my opinion, in the United States Constitution."</i></p>

<p>Everyone cheer the GOP!  This man is a verified loon (according to someone close to me.).</p>

<p>Let's take apart some of this:</p>

<p>Polygamy - a moral issue. Nothing more. There is no scientific reason or legal reason I can think of that I man or woman shouldn't be allowed to have any type of relationship he wishes. </p>

<p>Bigamy - the legal term of polygamy. A plurality of spouses and nothing more. Same as argument for polygamy.</p>

<p>Incest - There is a scientific basis for the laws against this. Besides that, incest issues usually arise from parents raping children against the will of the child. A whole other legal issue there.</p>

<p>Adultery - While it's ground for legal divorce, it's still a moral issue if anything. </p>

<p>The fact that he would relate the behaviour of two CONSENTING adults to engage in behaviour CONSENTED to by the aforementioned CONSENTING adults is just silly.</p>

<p>Of course we get to the meat of the matter in a later statement. These behaviours are antiethical to a stable, healthy, traditional family! OF COURSE!</p>

<p>Traditions change folks. Do we still give goats as dowry? I hope not! When Michelle and I were at the Dogwood Festival, we took a break to eat lunch. As we were sitting there, I noticed a gay couple on the blanket across from us. In Atlanta, this is no big deal. What was interesting is that these two gay men, a couple, were taking care of a baby. They took turns feeding and rocking and burping and doing all the things that parents would do. I pointed it out and we remarked on it for a while. Sure we saw straight couples behaving the same way but none of them exhibited the overt love and joy that these two men did over that child. There are bad eggs in every family but I'm guessing that child gets more love than a child in most straight families.</p>

<p>I say to you again, "The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."</p>

<p>You may feel that God is going to strike down the United States because of the behaviour of its immorality but I will tell you that a government that avoids legislating the personal morality of one man over another is the only one in which you would be allowed to have that belief.</p>

<p>And as to his comment about a false sense of privacy, it is true that it is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution but, to take a quote from the ACLU:</p>

<p><i>"WHAT IS THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY?</p>

<p>The right to privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court has said that several of the amendments create this right. One of the amendments is the Fourth Amendment, which stops the police and other government agents from searching us or our property without "probable cause" to believe that we have committed a crime. Other amendments protect our freedom to make certain decisions about our bodies and our private lives without interference from the government </i>"</p>

<p>It seems that the Supremes would disagree with the Senator's Constitutional Law understanding.</p>

<p>You may have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom of consequences. The government cannot restrict your right to speech (within reason - fire in a crowded theater) but that doesn't mean that the public can't make judegements about you based on your speech.</p>

<p>Just as I judge the Dixie Chicks and Michael Moore, so I judge Senator Santorum. </p>

<p>Blithering idiot.</p>

<p>As a side note, this guy has a history of trying to force his morality into law and making statements as such:</p>
