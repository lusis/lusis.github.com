<p>that I don't care about the political party but the issue at hand, Rick Boucher (D-VA) has written an excellent article for cnet's news.com.</p>


<p>The article is here:</p>

<p>The MPAA and RIAA both are monopolistic entities that seek to stifle the free market. The DMCA is the tool of those monopolies to restrict Fair Use of material you paid for.</p>

<span class="title">Famous Quotes rock</span>

<p>I love this quote and it was mentioned again on Boston Public lastnight.</p>


<p><i>“Those who would trade freedom for security deserve neither.”</i></p>

<p>People are saying that the government is temporarily suspending our freedoms for security.</p>

<p>The government can't do that. Remember what the declaration of independance says. We were endowed by our creator with certain rights. Until the government  (and more so the people of the United States!) realize that they are only here to defend what our creator has given us and that they don't have the ability nor the right to take them away, we will not get it right.</p>

<p>Sorry about the disconnectedness of the rant but I had to get it out and I seriously needed a break from coding our Disk Imaging software fro the training room.</p>

<p>Back to work! hehe.</p>
