<span class="title">checks and balances: Bush Administration reminder</span>

<p>Jose Padilla gets to see his lawyers!</p>


<p>Now before I go any further, let me say that i think the guy is scum. I think he is useless and that I hope he gets the full force of the law brought against him.</p>

<p>Some of you may not remember. I'm guessing the Bush Administration and the Ashcroft Regime was happy if that's the case.</p>

<p>An American citizen was being held illegally by the military. He was denied Due Process and all his rights were stripped.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that. </p>

<p>And American citizen. Just like you and just like me. Not someone in the States on a Visa. Nothing at all like that. Mind you he's a criminal with a gang record, but he is still a citizen and by the U.S. Constitution, entitled to certain rights as such.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was detained by the government for having SUSPECTED ties to Al Qaeda. They said he MIGHT have been involved in a plot to detonate a dirty bomb.</p>

<p>Let's cut through all the emotional rhetoric and get down to what this really is.</p>

<p>Despite his ties, if any, to Al Qaeda, this was a citizen of this country who was arrested for his thoughts.</p>

<p>Thoughtcrime.</p>

<p>The government claimed he was an "enemy combatant" and therefore his rights were out the window. </p>

<p>Jose Padilla didn't rise up and take arms against the U.S. He was arrested on a material witness warrant and secretly held in a government prison.</p>

<p>This vague "enemy combatant" crap has to go. He didn't DO anything. The government had to nothing but label him and he looses all his rights? I don't remember reading that part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>As bad as some people think it sounds, there are different rules for citizens and non-citizens. If you want the protection of the Constitution of the United States, only one thing is asked in return. That is to be a citizen of the United States. It says "We the people of the Untied States of America"  not "We the people of the world". If you are a citizen of this country, our government's job is to ensure the rights set forth in that document.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was granted that right by birth. Whether or not he deserves it is not up for the government to decide. I'm still researching but as far as I understand, the only way you can revoke your birth-right citizenship in the U.S., other than filing for it, is to physically go to war for a foreign government against the U.S. Most of the stuff I've found online involves denaturalizing immigrants.</p>

<p>Let me remind everyone yet again, I don't support this Padilla character IF he was indeed planning (not actually doing) these things but if I want my birthrights to stay secure, I have to stand up for his.</p>

<p>Let the government play fair ball the way they've had to for 200 years and convict him in a U.S. court.</p>

<span class="title">IP, Mickey Mouse and Alan Moore</span>

<p>I sent a link to my boss about the <a href="http://www.archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php">Internet Archive Bookmobile</a> (Click through if you don't know what it is).</p>


<p>He replyed back with his opinion as a comic book fan and provided <a href="http://161.58.84.234/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=2&t=000069 ">this</a> link. approaching IP from a capitalist and open-source point of view, I began to wonder why I was so opposed to IP so much. Could I reconcile the two?</p>

<p>I found quite a few links via google:<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=capitalism+%2B+intellectual+property&btnG=Google+Search">google results</a></p>

<p>One that stuck out most was <a href="http://www.ecommercebase.com/article/727">here</a>.</p>

<p>My conclusion was that perpetual intellectual property (such as espoused by the Sonny Bono copyright Act) actual hinders competition and encourages monopoly behaviour. The Framers understood ,rather clearly, this concept and provided for it in the Constitution:</p>

<p>"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."</p>

<p>Yes, you should be rewarded for your hard work but don't get lazy because the same rights that allowed you to get to this point are going to allow someone else to get there as well. Make the most of it because soon your idea becomes public domain so it can be expounded on and fuel competition in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The solution? </p>

<p>Make a better Mickey Mouse. </p>

<span class="title">Happy Birthday</span>

<p>[from the lusis.org archives]</p>


<p>[Editors note - as if Im really an editor - I dont normally post personal correspondance to the public but this just came out of me this afternoon. Someone sent me an email and asked me if I were ever serious since Im always sarchastic. I wanted the rest of the world to because getting this honest is semi-painful and yet feels so damn good sometimes.]</p>

<p><br />
Im going to be serious here for a moment. Im actually a very serious person<br />
when it comes to alot of things. I find humour disarms most people so thats<br />
my schtick as it were. I have a very intense life at times. Hell my life is<br />
intense most of the time. Im a deep person is what it comes down to. (ignore<br />
the dangling preposition).</p>

<p><br />
Lets see. My brain works entirely too hard. I overthink EVERYTHING in life. I<br />
want to get married and settle down and have kids and have a life and have<br />
someone special I can talk to about anything and everything. I want alot of<br />
things but that eternal companionship is what I really want more than<br />
anything.</p>

<p><br />
I have bills. I have some debt. I regret not having finished college. I regret<br />
not having the money nor anyone to provide it for me to finish college.</p>

<p><br />
I was almost a youth minister. I have deep seated feelings regarding religion.<br />
I think about politics too much. I worry about where the world is going and<br />
how corporations are doing everything in thier power to restrict my rights and<br />
yet, as a capitalist, I think they have a right to make money.</p>

<p><br />
Im tired of the US being the worlds bitch (pardon my not-so-frenchy french).<br />
im tired of everyone but me and the people I care about trying to get into my<br />
business.</p>

<p><br />
I get frustrated with my (lack of) sex life when all I really want is someone<br />
to hold and cuddle and pour out all these emotions that are meant for the one<br />
you love.</p>

<p><br />
I wonder if Im really qualified to do my job. Do i have what it takes to make<br />
it in this world? (No thoughts of suicide here so put the phone down ;> )</p>

<p><br />
I regret having taken drugs in the past and yet I dont regret being able to<br />
tell my kids someday that, while I dont think they should, Im powerless to<br />
stop it unless I can institute in them a greater respect for themselves. Dont<br />
worry I wasnt a crack addict or anything. i smoked pot and whatnot. The part<br />
I regret is the fact that I did something to damage my most valuable assett -<br />
my mind. Try reconciling all of that with the fact that I think all drugs<br />
should be legal since its not the governments (especially a government that<br />
I dont trust as far as I can throw it) job to govern my life when Im not<br />
hurting anyone but myself.</p>

<p><br />
I want to make music and listen to music and feel music because its the<br />
soundtrack of my life.</p>

<p><br />
I want to read and I want to be able to stop time just so that I can have more<br />
time to read.</p>

<p><br />
I want the world to stop noticing me and yet pay more attention to me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All in all, I just think entirely too damn much. My sarchasm isnt so much<br />
because Im cynical, as it is that I want others to laugh and be able to<br />
forget about the world around them and just enjoy life. Dont worry about the<br />
things you cant change, they tell me.</p>

<p><br />
Screw you, I tell them. Im human. Its called compassion.</p>

<p><br />
Happy birthday and I hope you have a famous one. I hope your friends take you<br />
to the moon so you can see the world without the dirty details that so often<br />
drag us down. </p>

<span class="title">Even an asshole like me can change his mind</span>

<p>[from the lusis.org archives]</p>


<p>Well gang I recently decided to try the online matchmaking thing again. After my last bit of anger and rage, I locked myself in the batcave and didn't come up for days. I realized that I should just focus on my work and tell society to bugger off.</p>

<p><br />
It's actually gone well this time. I realized a few things about myself. Let's run down the list shall we?</p>

<p><br />
1: I'm an asshole. I knew this and most people who know me know this. I love people and I hate em at the same time. My tolerance for idiocy is about NIL. I just had to realize that I have to deal with all sorts of people and the fact that I'm better than them is something I'll just have to accept. If you haven't noticed yet this rant is tinged with sarchasm. I like sarchasm. Deal with it.</p>

<p><br />
2: I don't know how to speak Australian. I just realized this as I listen to a nifty commercial on the radio that seems to be selling something, that as I've said before, my life would suck without. I believe it's fosters beer but I can't be sure since the only good beers I've ever had come from Europe not some prison colony. *looks around to make sure none of the handful of aussie's I know are waiting in the wings with bats and stuff..damn prison escapees ;> )</p>

<p><br />
3: I needed to broaden my horizons. I'm actually a fairly likeable person now. I'll talk to anyone at anytime about anything. That is, unless it has to do with something I can't relate to like "that time of the month" or math.</p>

<p><br />
4: I hate math. I've always known this one. I hate it with a passion. My dad is a freakin genius at math. Meanwhile my mom had to record my multiplication tables onto cassette and play them for me while I slept. As a kid that is. I don't live with my mom. Dumbasses ;)</p>

<p><br />
5: I like politics. Back in the...er...religious shall we say..days, I was a republican with a mission from God. Fear me and my whitebread american upbringing. (there was some sort of social policy in there as well that wasn't entirely republican but we won't talk about that). Now I'm a libertarian. I want the money that I worked my fingers (or my brain depending on how you look at what network geeks do for a living) to the bone. It's not government's responsibility to create and maintain social programs. None whatsoever. I advocate the complete abolishment of Social Security (or as I like to call it, the evil legally sanctioned insurance scam) and a federal income tax. I think all drugs should be legal because who is the government to decide what people can and can't do to thier bodies. If some jackass overdoses on heroin then I say good riddance. He was a dumbass for using it in the first place. I did alot of drugs in my earlier years (I can see my parents reading this and having massive heartattacks now) but did I become addicted? Hell no. I'm alot stronger than that. The only drug I do now is Guiness and the occasional cigar when I've had too much of the aformentioned Guiness.</p>

<p><br />
6: I still hate math. I just wanted people to get that one down pat.</p>

<p><br />
7: I have a strong distaste for someone who thinks they have a right to my private information because it will help them sell dog food. You want my information then ask me. Otherwise bugger off and die a slow painful death. I want to give a special shout out to all the homies in marketting at Doubleclick. How's the bubble burst treatin ya? Hehehehe.</p>

<p><br />
8: I still hate lawyers. Nothing much can be done about this. They may be great people on the inside but until the ambulance chasers and patent junkies die, it's really gonna be hard for me to tolerate the majority of them. I hate to lump you all together (hell I used to wanna be a lawyer but latin class was full freshman year and I got stuck in french. It was all downhill from there) but one bad egg can ruin the whole carton.</p>

<p><br />
9: No mom, I'm not gay. I never was nor have I ever been. I only throw this in because I'm sure she'll misread it and freak out. It's a mean trick but it's the only one I can use on her and not feel bad about ;)</p>

<p><br />
10: Finally we get to the end. I hadn't planned this to be a David Letterman top 10 list but hey, get the ideas where you can right? I love life. I was a pretty bitter person having never finished college and all that but look where I am now? I have a nice apartment, a cool dog (stupid but cool anyway), a great job in the middle of a really slow economy that I've had for 3 years now, I found where I fit in this world and all is well with life. I can't say this enough. I'm an irritating person sometimes but even the happiest of us have to get out the anger.</p>

<p><br />
So in closing, life is good and all is well in the world. There's that small bit with China right now but seriously people. Did you actually think they could play fair with the rest of the kids on the playground? You did? Bless your little liberal heart! </p>

<span class="title">Dating</span>

<p>[from the lusis.org archives]</p>


<p>Im sitting in my office writing this with the air conditioning off as a form of catharsis. Its hot and Im pissy. Any fucking questions?</p>

<p><br />
On with the fun.</p>

<p><br />
I started dating again recently. It was a fairly intentional choice. For the past few years I havent dated, not since Liz. I consider relationships to be something serious and since I didnt seem to have the time to invest in one.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now if you can believe that total bullshit I just fed you then we can go on with this like adults. I HAVENT dated in the sense of the word since Liz but Ive gone out on occasion. My latest forays were an intentional effort on my part to start going out with women again. I signed up for matchmaker at the behest of afriend who had success there. The questionaires were well thought out and provided for a wonderful overview of not only yourself but anyone you might be interested in. Having submitted a profile, I filled out the numerous essay questions. These essay questions are basically the same thing you got in a standardized school test only having more bearing on your life than explaining why a train travelling from point A to point B at a rate of 95 miles an hour would eventually crash and cause despair to hundreds of families. On these pages of answers you would entice and ensnare a possible dinner partner whos entire opinion of you would be formed around, not only whether or not you would own X rated movies or had considered a homosexual experience, but also what you considered "SEXY", who you would have lunch with if you could have lunch with one person and whatever else you felt like they didnt ask you. I had no made myself open to one and all who might wonder what I was all about.</p>

<p><br />
I waited anxiously for my picture to be approved and get posted. I decided to check my matches and see what my options were. Lets see....65 miles from my location maximum. only seeking women thank you very much. Lets just see the ones with pictures for now. No one under 18 and over 30. Should be easy enough. SUBMIT! The page refreshed and I was presented with a list of possible matches based on how they answered the same questions I did. Some had essay answers and some did not. Lets click this one here.</p>

<p><br />
..................</p>

<p>Ahh now she looks normal. Lets see we seem to match 56%. Wonderful! Lets find what shes about shall we? Hrmmm. Interesting. Okay so multiple choice questions dont say much. I wonder what she said in her essay questions.</p>

<p>...............</p>

<p><br />
Q. What are you looking for in a mate?</p>

<p>A. I WOULD LIKE A MAN WHO IS ATTRACTIVE AND WELL MANNERED AND CUTE AND TALL AND FISCALLY SECURE AND CAN TREAT ME LIKE THE PRINCESS I AM!</p>

<p><br />
Where the fuck is my gun? Why did I drag myself into this? I hate people WHO THINK TYPING LIKE THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF COMMUNICATION!!!!!! LOL LOL LOL</p>

<p><br />
I come from the old days of bbs, muds and even the more recent IRC where typing in caps is to imply YELLING! Get it? I couldnt get past the first damn essay question. In the words of the great and oft late ImANewbie, "This doth not bode well."</p>

<p><br />
I proceded to check other matches to see what was up. Somethings got better and somethings got worse. I learned the quick and easy way to decide whether or not to finish a profile. I checked the answers to two multiple choice questions and the first essay question (which was always about what you looked for in a mate). The two questions I checked first are these:</p>

<p><br />
Q: What is your annual income?</p>

<p>Less than $12k</p>

<p>$12k - $15k</p>

<p>$15k - $25k</p>

<p>$25k - $35k</p>

<p>$35k - $50k</p>

<p>$50k - $75k</p>

<p>$75k - $100k</p>

<p>$100k - $150k</p>

<p>$150k - $200k</p>

<p>$200k - $250k</p>

<p>Over $250k</p>

<p>None of your damn business!</p>

<p>What, me work?</p>

<p><br />
Now if I ever saw "None of your damn business" that was one strike. If you are that insecure about what you do in life then I dont care for you. Next question:</p>

<p><br />
Q. How many X-rated movies do you OWN?</p>

<p>None, and I never will!</p>

<p>None, but I rent them</p>

<p>None, but Ill watch one with you</p>

<p>1 X-movie</p>

<p>2 - 5 X-movies</p>

<p>6 - 10 X-movies</p>

<p>11 - 25 X-movies</p>

<p>Over 25 X-movies</p>

<p>Im in some of them!</p>

<p><br />
"None and I never will" was another strike. "Im in some of them" is a sign that God does exist. Most common answer was c. "None, but Ill watch one with you"</p>

<p><br />
So and so forth to the essay question.<br />
The whole process wasnt a waste. I met several nice women. All of them intelligent (my primary desire) and willing to watch "Lukes freak party 101 with the big booty chicks in Miami" at least once. Yet in each case except for one, something would hinder a chance for a relationship to go anywhere. Im not Jewish so anything more than a casual relationship (these two words do not go together in my book. Friends dont fuck friends. If we arent having sex then we are friends. If we are, its a relationship). I dont have time to swing dance. While I have been over my last realtionship, you are actually still in yours and not ready to leave anytime soon. Sorry Im selfish. Its all me or nothing.</p>

<p><br />
In fairness to all of these fine ladies, this is part of what dating is all about. Finding out what the other person likes and doesnt like. Will it work or wont it work. Do we even have fun together. Is there any attraction to each other?</p>

<p><br />
I hate dating. I hate small talk. I hate bullshitting and talking about nothing that matters in the end. I cant stand it. I loathe it and that in itself is an understatement. By dating I mean this trial and error meet and greet. This is why I dont go to buckhead. I hate the auction block ass for sale attitude that its about. That and Im not a fratboy with a backwards cap and pecs the size of my dog so I go pretty much unnoticed.</p>

<p><br />
Say what you will but I think God has preordained certain people to marry and others to stay single. Then there are the people like me. We just write about it. </p>
