<p>Okay I'm miffed.</p>


<p>I was doing a normal emerge on my home system (gentoo) and upgraded glibc. It seems that codeweavers crossover AND transgaming winex are now borked. It's not a HUGE deal (I can't remember the last time I actually NEEDED the quicktime plugin under linux and I use my laptop to play Ultima Online since UOAssist doesn't play well with WineX.) but it's still annoying.  </p>

<p>What gets me is I went from glibc-2.3.1 to glibc-2.3.2. How much could have changed in a freaking DOT RELEASE?</p>

<p>I'm not so sure that the Transgaming people are willing to help out on the matter. The answer about it being b0rked came from the codeweaver team who actually seem to care about the customers. I'm not a big fan of the Transgaming method of supporting games.  Sure the vote method is nice but when it comes down to me just wanting UOAssist to work, it doesn't do much good. My hope is that whatever fixes are integrated into WineX 3.0 will automatically fix it.</p>

<p>My REAL problem with Transgaming is the release schedule. It seems the keep tabs on when the majority of the subscriptions are expiring and then they don't release until AFTER that date. Sort of a microcosm of the whole subscription software model. At least the old version doesn't expire.</p>

<p>I REALLY like the method that The Kompany uses with Kapital. I get a non-redistributable copy of the Kapital sourcecode to build myself if the precompiled ones don't work. I understand that Transgaming has Safedisc code to worry about but that could be handled like Nvidia does where those libs must be downloaded alone and integrated at compile time.</p>

<p>Who knows. If anyone has any tips on the glibc problem or can assure me that downgrading my glibc is safe, I would appreciate it!</p>

<p>Michelle and I got engaged Thursday night. I was crafty and smooth and it payed off.</p>

<p>Actually I was a nervous wreck. </p>

<p>I had the ring for 3 weeks prior. I WANTED to give it to her the night we found out we were pre-approved for our homeloan but I hadn't spoken with her parents at the time. They came down over Valentine's Day weekend along with her brother and his fiancee. We went to the RedWings game and the outlets and what not.</p>

<p>But back to the ring! (My precious as Michelle calls it. Scary!)</p>

<p>I had been planning on going out on a date this week. Friday and the rest of the weekend was out because she had a class all day each day. That left Thursday (farthest day out). We got dressed to go out to eat but we stopped across the street at Vickery Creek to take a walk. There's a nice set of cliffs there that alot of folks like to climb down. I took a couple of pictures of the cliff (knowing full well she would want a memory of it as would I).</p>

<p>Then I got her over by the cliffs to take a picture. She wanted to take one of me too. So I went over to the edge and waited. I put my hands in my pocket and felt the box. Something came over me and I pulled it out and opened it while she had the viewfinder up. She let the camera down and asked me what that was as I walked closer to her with the box open. I asked. She said yes.</p>

<p>After we got calmed down and sat down on the rocks, she said "Are you for real?". Heh.</p>

<p>Anyways, I've uploaded some pictures to the gallery. You can get to them <a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/album23">here</a>. YAH!</p>

<p>Here are a few links I've found from various sources. </p>


<p>I've decided to at least provide some links daily even if I can't entertain you with my witty banter. </p>

<p>By the way, does anyone OTHER than my family actually read this damn site? It's more of a personal journal for me than anything. Isn't that all blogs really are? A distributed forum? People respond to blogs from other sources all the time. <a href="nataliesolent.blogspot.com">Natalie Solent</a> comments on <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog">Samizdata</a> or <a href="http://www.instapundit.com">Instapundit</a>. <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> links to <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a> (although k5 would never link to a /. story ;>).</p>

<p>Blogging is like some sort of inbred family reunion. In the end, everyone is related to someone else.</p>

<p>Oh yeah....the links:<br />
<a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20030220-19499864.htm">Walter Williams gets it right</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/opinion/0203/20zell.html">Once again, Zell Miller says all the right things</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/20030220-11583742.htm">I knew something was up!</a></p>

<p><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">I finally decided to read Doc's weblog</a><br />
and he showed me <a href="http://blogstreet.com/visualneighborhood.html">this</a>. Too bad I'm not in there!</p>

<p>Speaking of Doc, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">LinuxJournal this month talks about blogs</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com/">The most interesting blog I've found recently.</a> It's a personal tips and tricks blog that, while geared to churches, is applicable to anyone with a website </p>

<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/ac/?id=110003062">Sex, Drugs And Rock-n-Roll!</a> is the title of a nice article on the libertarian differences with convservatives.</p>


<p>One thing I've heard Neal Boortz say time and time again is that he guarantees that he values freedom more than you. I would say the same thing about myself.</p>

<p>Let me discuss some examples about my personal philosophy in terms of a hot topic issue...abortion.</p>

<p>I'm against abortion. I don't like the thought of it being used as a form of birth control. I don't like what it says about a society. It just doesn't sit well with me.</p>

<p>Having read that you may think, "You're against a woman's right to choose!".</p>

<p>You would be wrong.</p>

<p>Abortion is a moral issue. My feelings on the subject are based soley in my own moral founding. Because of that, I don't think that the government has any business saying what a person can do with her own body.</p>

<p>You see, I think that government has NO business in anyone's personal life. I don't feel that it is proper for a government to try and legislate morality. As long as a person's behaviour doesn't affect deprive me of life, liberty and personal property, the gubment has no business making a ruling one way or the other.</p>

<p>It is because of this alone that I am a libertarian. I value personal liberty above all else.  I cannot, in my heart and mind and soul, expect personal freedom, if I am not willing to extend that self same freedom to someone who shares a different belief system.</p>

<p>People often tell me that libertarian ideas are nice in theory but things that they propose have not been tested. I say hogwash. The principles of the LP and indeed and right-thinking freedom loving individual are the selfsame ideas that this country was founded on. </p>

<p>"How would our government survive without income tax?!?!?"<br />
- Read up on tax history. The country did just fine without it until the early part of the 1900's.</p>

<p>"Drugs are bad! They must be illegal!"<br />
- Yes drugs are bad. So is booze. We tried this with prohibition. Worked well didn't it? What trouble does it cause you if Bill decides to smoke a joint before bed? How does it deprive you of your life, your liberty or your own personal property. I'm not saying it shouldn't be regualted. In fact, I think it should be handled just like alchohol is handled today. DUI and all.</p>

<p>There is one quote from someone who I believe to be the most freedom-minded individual in history, Thomas Jefferson. It sums up everything I believe about freedom and government and politics. Readi t and think about it. You might actually be enlightened.</p>

<p><B>"The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."</B><i>--Thomas Jefferson</i><br />
