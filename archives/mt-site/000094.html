<p><a title="Free Mike Hawash" href="http://www.freemikehawash.org/">Free Mike Hawash</a></p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>I randomly found this site on the web this afternoon and got sick to my stomach. I don't know anything about the guy only what I've read on the website and the linked <a title="Original Oregonian Article" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/104825159914540.xml">Oregonian website</a> as well as <a title="Letter to the Editor by Mike's friend" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/letters/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/104859701879330.xml">the letter to the editor</a> by one of his co-workers.</p>

<p>My understanding is that contributions he made to one of the charities that was later to be determined as funding terrorist activities is the reason behind this.</p>

<p>This really underscores a greater problem with the Patriot Act and John Ashcroft. That is the fact that he is a menace to this country and the Constitution of the United States, a document that I hold most dear to my heart. I also blame the congresscritters who allowed it to happen. </p>

<p>I don't care if this man was plotting to blow up the entire state of Oregon. He's a goddamned UNITED STATES CITIZEN. Doesn't that mean anything to anyone anymore? Oh wait, he's middle eastern. He's a terrorist. GET HIM! Forget the fact that he has rights confered to him as a UNITED STATES CITIZEN!</p>

<p>They may find out that he was actively involved in a plot to release a dirty bomb at Intel. I don't care. The fucking federal government has to operate within the fucking rules that were laid down in this country by people who left England to avoid this sort of thing. Due process you bastards. </p>

<p>I relish the day when we find out that the Red Cross has been indirectly sponsoring some sort of terrorist campaign. Then maybe we'll find a list of donors that has John Ashcroft on it. He might have some time to think about what he's done to this country while he's getting the living shit beat out of him by some overzelous FBI agent.</p>

<p>This whole post may land ME in a cell next to "Mike" Hawash. At least then I can apologize to him for wasting his time learning the Constitution and becoming a citizen. I'd rather KNOW that I'm living in fear under a dictator than having a false sense of security.</p>

<p>Do we really feel any safer?</p>
