<p>[Editors note - as if Im really an editor - I dont normally post personal correspondance to the public but this just came out of me this afternoon. Someone sent me an email and asked me if I were ever serious since Im always sarchastic. I wanted the rest of the world to because getting this honest is semi-painful and yet feels so damn good sometimes.]</p>

<p><br />
Im going to be serious here for a moment. Im actually a very serious person<br />
when it comes to alot of things. I find humour disarms most people so thats<br />
my schtick as it were. I have a very intense life at times. Hell my life is<br />
intense most of the time. Im a deep person is what it comes down to. (ignore<br />
the dangling preposition).</p>

<p><br />
Lets see. My brain works entirely too hard. I overthink EVERYTHING in life. I<br />
want to get married and settle down and have kids and have a life and have<br />
someone special I can talk to about anything and everything. I want alot of<br />
things but that eternal companionship is what I really want more than<br />
anything.</p>

<p><br />
I have bills. I have some debt. I regret not having finished college. I regret<br />
not having the money nor anyone to provide it for me to finish college.</p>

<p><br />
I was almost a youth minister. I have deep seated feelings regarding religion.<br />
I think about politics too much. I worry about where the world is going and<br />
how corporations are doing everything in thier power to restrict my rights and<br />
yet, as a capitalist, I think they have a right to make money.</p>

<p><br />
Im tired of the US being the worlds bitch (pardon my not-so-frenchy french).<br />
im tired of everyone but me and the people I care about trying to get into my<br />
business.</p>

<p><br />
I get frustrated with my (lack of) sex life when all I really want is someone<br />
to hold and cuddle and pour out all these emotions that are meant for the one<br />
you love.</p>

<p><br />
I wonder if Im really qualified to do my job. Do i have what it takes to make<br />
it in this world? (No thoughts of suicide here so put the phone down ;> )</p>

<p><br />
I regret having taken drugs in the past and yet I dont regret being able to<br />
tell my kids someday that, while I dont think they should, Im powerless to<br />
stop it unless I can institute in them a greater respect for themselves. Dont<br />
worry I wasnt a crack addict or anything. i smoked pot and whatnot. The part<br />
I regret is the fact that I did something to damage my most valuable assett -<br />
my mind. Try reconciling all of that with the fact that I think all drugs<br />
should be legal since its not the governments (especially a government that<br />
I dont trust as far as I can throw it) job to govern my life when Im not<br />
hurting anyone but myself.</p>

<p><br />
I want to make music and listen to music and feel music because its the<br />
soundtrack of my life.</p>

<p><br />
I want to read and I want to be able to stop time just so that I can have more<br />
time to read.</p>

<p><br />
I want the world to stop noticing me and yet pay more attention to me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All in all, I just think entirely too damn much. My sarchasm isnt so much<br />
because Im cynical, as it is that I want others to laugh and be able to<br />
forget about the world around them and just enjoy life. Dont worry about the<br />
things you cant change, they tell me.</p>

<p><br />
Screw you, I tell them. Im human. Its called compassion.</p>

<p><br />
Happy birthday and I hope you have a famous one. I hope your friends take you<br />
to the moon so you can see the world without the dirty details that so often<br />
drag us down. </p>

<span class="title">Even an asshole like me can change his mind</span>

<p>[from the lusis.org archives]</p>


<p>Well gang I recently decided to try the online matchmaking thing again. After my last bit of anger and rage, I locked myself in the batcave and didn't come up for days. I realized that I should just focus on my work and tell society to bugger off.</p>

<p><br />
It's actually gone well this time. I realized a few things about myself. Let's run down the list shall we?</p>

<p><br />
1: I'm an asshole. I knew this and most people who know me know this. I love people and I hate em at the same time. My tolerance for idiocy is about NIL. I just had to realize that I have to deal with all sorts of people and the fact that I'm better than them is something I'll just have to accept. If you haven't noticed yet this rant is tinged with sarchasm. I like sarchasm. Deal with it.</p>

<p><br />
2: I don't know how to speak Australian. I just realized this as I listen to a nifty commercial on the radio that seems to be selling something, that as I've said before, my life would suck without. I believe it's fosters beer but I can't be sure since the only good beers I've ever had come from Europe not some prison colony. *looks around to make sure none of the handful of aussie's I know are waiting in the wings with bats and stuff..damn prison escapees ;> )</p>

<p><br />
3: I needed to broaden my horizons. I'm actually a fairly likeable person now. I'll talk to anyone at anytime about anything. That is, unless it has to do with something I can't relate to like "that time of the month" or math.</p>

<p><br />
4: I hate math. I've always known this one. I hate it with a passion. My dad is a freakin genius at math. Meanwhile my mom had to record my multiplication tables onto cassette and play them for me while I slept. As a kid that is. I don't live with my mom. Dumbasses ;)</p>

<p><br />
5: I like politics. Back in the...er...religious shall we say..days, I was a republican with a mission from God. Fear me and my whitebread american upbringing. (there was some sort of social policy in there as well that wasn't entirely republican but we won't talk about that). Now I'm a libertarian. I want the money that I worked my fingers (or my brain depending on how you look at what network geeks do for a living) to the bone. It's not government's responsibility to create and maintain social programs. None whatsoever. I advocate the complete abolishment of Social Security (or as I like to call it, the evil legally sanctioned insurance scam) and a federal income tax. I think all drugs should be legal because who is the government to decide what people can and can't do to thier bodies. If some jackass overdoses on heroin then I say good riddance. He was a dumbass for using it in the first place. I did alot of drugs in my earlier years (I can see my parents reading this and having massive heartattacks now) but did I become addicted? Hell no. I'm alot stronger than that. The only drug I do now is Guiness and the occasional cigar when I've had too much of the aformentioned Guiness.</p>

<p><br />
6: I still hate math. I just wanted people to get that one down pat.</p>

<p><br />
7: I have a strong distaste for someone who thinks they have a right to my private information because it will help them sell dog food. You want my information then ask me. Otherwise bugger off and die a slow painful death. I want to give a special shout out to all the homies in marketting at Doubleclick. How's the bubble burst treatin ya? Hehehehe.</p>

<p><br />
8: I still hate lawyers. Nothing much can be done about this. They may be great people on the inside but until the ambulance chasers and patent junkies die, it's really gonna be hard for me to tolerate the majority of them. I hate to lump you all together (hell I used to wanna be a lawyer but latin class was full freshman year and I got stuck in french. It was all downhill from there) but one bad egg can ruin the whole carton.</p>

<p><br />
9: No mom, I'm not gay. I never was nor have I ever been. I only throw this in because I'm sure she'll misread it and freak out. It's a mean trick but it's the only one I can use on her and not feel bad about ;)</p>

<p><br />
10: Finally we get to the end. I hadn't planned this to be a David Letterman top 10 list but hey, get the ideas where you can right? I love life. I was a pretty bitter person having never finished college and all that but look where I am now? I have a nice apartment, a cool dog (stupid but cool anyway), a great job in the middle of a really slow economy that I've had for 3 years now, I found where I fit in this world and all is well with life. I can't say this enough. I'm an irritating person sometimes but even the happiest of us have to get out the anger.</p>

<p><br />
So in closing, life is good and all is well in the world. There's that small bit with China right now but seriously people. Did you actually think they could play fair with the rest of the kids on the playground? You did? Bless your little liberal heart! </p>
