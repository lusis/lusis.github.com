<p><a title="'Suspected terrorist' removed from flight | Metafilter" href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/27098">John Gilmore is raising more hell</a></p>


<p>I&apos;ve been following <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/" title="yes he IS somewhat weird!">John Gilmore</a> for a while. Despite my desire wanting to smack him around for not knowing the difference between a democracy and a federal republic, I was really interested in <a href="http://freetotravel.org/" title="NO TICKET!">his case against the government</a> that requires a picture ID to fly nowadays. At one point, I printed out the entire brief and took it with me on a trip to Michigan hoping to get the Huffman family lawyer to look at it.</p>

<p>I got my email from <a href="http://www.politechbot.com" title="Geeks and Politics">Politech</a> over the weekend. Michelle and I both were a bit flabergasted when I finished reading her the story.</p>

<p>I think the whole thing is just stupid. I also think British Airways might want to retrain the flight crew on the stupidity of thinking that security screener would give a badge to a &quot;suspected terrorist&quot; to identify him.</p>

<p>John Gilmore is actually making a bigger statement with this. Were his civil rights violated? Not in the least.  The real key lies in what he says after discussing things with a BA rep:</p>

<p>&quot;<br />
I asked whether I would be permitted to fly if I wore other buttons,<br />
perhaps one saying &quot;Hooray for Tony Blair&quot;.  She said she thought that<br />
would be OK.<br />
&quot;</p>

<p>People like Sean Hannity, like to rail against opposing speech saying that it's unpatriotic to question authority in a time of war or that it crosses a line at some point. Of ocurse only the active political party can tell you what that line is but let's ignore that.</p>

<p>I also like this part:</p>

<p>&quot;<br />
I told her that it refers to all of us, everyone, being<br />
suspected of being terrorists, being searched without cause, being<br />
queued in lines and pens, forced to take our shoes off, to identify<br />
ourselves, to drink our own breast milk, to submit to indignities.<br />
Everyone is a suspected terrorist in today&apos;s America, including all<br />
the innocent people, and that's wrong.<br />
&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to political correctness, we aren&apos;t allowed to profile criminals because it's racism we are left with the above situation.</p>

<p>I&apos;d also like to point out some misconceptions that Mr. Gilmore has w.r.t. BA. I find some of this rather surprising since he allowed himself to be interview by <a href="http://www.reason.com" title='free minds and free markets">a magazine</a> that is named after something he seems to be missing.</p>

<p>As I&apos;ve said in the past, censorship and freedom of speech ONLY applies to the government in the Constitution. Even then there are some restrictions (of which are common sense restrictions). BA has every right to restrict Mr. Gilmore&apos;s political speech.  This is the other side of free speech - as it relates to individuals. You have freedom of speech but not freedom from consequences. As with the Dixie Chicks, Natalie was perfectly free to say that she was ashamed that the president was from her state but that might come with consequences. In her case, radio stations refused to play her music. That was the freedom of speech the radio stationed exercised. Some people even went off and had mass record burnings. I personally think that was more scary. It is also proof why our government is not a pure democracy and why it is so dangerous.</p>

<p>The second aspect is the guilt by association. Individuals are allowed to make determination as to who the choose to do business with or associate with. In the case of BA, Mr. Gilmore was causing a ruckus (in the minds of the BA team anyway) and thus they might (rightly so) expect the same from his partner. As we know the assumption was wrong in the end but that is a consequence of guilt by association. Look at it this way, if you are being mugged and there is a person who is with the mugger but does not actually do anything wrong, he is still party to the crime. If you were an employer, would you hire someone on the recommendation of an employee you found to be lazy and non-productive? Probably not. You could be wrong but the people we associate with are a direct reflection of who we are.</p>

<p>I think I've done enough ranting for now though. Feel free to comment and tell me I'm wrong. If you find any logical flaws in what I am saying, I would also love to hear it. Either way, I am free to disagree. Gotta love freedom of speech. Works both ways!<br />
