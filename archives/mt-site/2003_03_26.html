<span class="title">Updated</span>

<p><a title="" href="http://www.lusis.org/static/userContent.css">Updated usercontent stylesheet</a></p>


<p>I've updated my file. I added:</p>

<pre>
IFRAME[SRC*="/html.ng"]  { display: none ! important }</pre>

<p>under the iframe section. It was already listed up under the IMG SRC entries but not for iframes. </p>

<p>The main reason for this is that stratics forums uses mediamgr.ugo.com for alot of the ads and the site runs DOG SLOW.</p>

<p>When are people going to realize that text ads work much better. People are assuming stratics forums are slow when the real problem is off-site third party banner ads!</p>

<p>Another update: I've found a link that discusses where mozilla stores it's profiles for each OS. Alot of people have asked me where in the hell to actually put the userContent.css file.</p>

<p>This is straight from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.0/#profiles">mozilla.org:</a></p>

<p>Profile Locations<br />
Windows %USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Mozilla\Profiles\[Profile Name]\[random string].slt\<br />
Windows 2000 C:\Documents and Settings\[Windows Login Name]\Application Data\Mozilla\Profiles\[Profile Name]\[random string].slt\<br />

<p>I finally got around to actually READING an article on the whole dolphin thing. Check it out. It's really cool.</p>

<p>I honestly thought they used the dolphins to set the mines off. Seemed like such a waste. These guys are trained, not only to find mines, but also drop tethers and swim back to the ships and push buttons.</p>

<p>The Navy also has sea lions and two white whales. ROCK ON!</p>

<p>John Ashcroft is a bastard and a danger to the Constitution. He's a U.S citizen. He has those rights. He's an asshole but he has those rights.</p>

<p>I'm more surprised that a creature such as a geek would sign up for the National Guard!</p>

<p>Follow up from Michelle:<br />
<A href="http://www.goats.com/">Goats</a> has this update -</p>

<p><i>In a related story, Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Ill are currently in a proverbial cold war over who has rights to the name "Megatron." Jong Ill clearly defined his postion in a recent press statment, saying directly to Mr. Hussein, "I knew Megatron and let me tell you something, Saddam. You are no Megatron. Starscream, sure, maybe even Galvatron, but Megatron? Nope, not going to happen."</i></p>

<p>Michelle sent this to me. Now that I've bothered to set up bookmarklets for publishing new entries, I can simply hit a button and upload a new link for all to see in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>I could do that before but this is so much easier.<br />
