<p>Okay I'm miffed.</p>


<p>I was doing a normal emerge on my home system (gentoo) and upgraded glibc. It seems that codeweavers crossover AND transgaming winex are now borked. It's not a HUGE deal (I can't remember the last time I actually NEEDED the quicktime plugin under linux and I use my laptop to play Ultima Online since UOAssist doesn't play well with WineX.) but it's still annoying.  </p>

<p>What gets me is I went from glibc-2.3.1 to glibc-2.3.2. How much could have changed in a freaking DOT RELEASE?</p>

<p>I'm not so sure that the Transgaming people are willing to help out on the matter. The answer about it being b0rked came from the codeweaver team who actually seem to care about the customers. I'm not a big fan of the Transgaming method of supporting games.  Sure the vote method is nice but when it comes down to me just wanting UOAssist to work, it doesn't do much good. My hope is that whatever fixes are integrated into WineX 3.0 will automatically fix it.</p>

<p>My REAL problem with Transgaming is the release schedule. It seems the keep tabs on when the majority of the subscriptions are expiring and then they don't release until AFTER that date. Sort of a microcosm of the whole subscription software model. At least the old version doesn't expire.</p>

<p>I REALLY like the method that The Kompany uses with Kapital. I get a non-redistributable copy of the Kapital sourcecode to build myself if the precompiled ones don't work. I understand that Transgaming has Safedisc code to worry about but that could be handled like Nvidia does where those libs must be downloaded alone and integrated at compile time.</p>

<p>Who knows. If anyone has any tips on the glibc problem or can assure me that downgrading my glibc is safe, I would appreciate it!</p>

<p>Michelle and I got engaged Thursday night. I was crafty and smooth and it payed off.</p>

<p>Actually I was a nervous wreck. </p>

<p>I had the ring for 3 weeks prior. I WANTED to give it to her the night we found out we were pre-approved for our homeloan but I hadn't spoken with her parents at the time. They came down over Valentine's Day weekend along with her brother and his fiancee. We went to the RedWings game and the outlets and what not.</p>

<p>But back to the ring! (My precious as Michelle calls it. Scary!)</p>

<p>I had been planning on going out on a date this week. Friday and the rest of the weekend was out because she had a class all day each day. That left Thursday (farthest day out). We got dressed to go out to eat but we stopped across the street at Vickery Creek to take a walk. There's a nice set of cliffs there that alot of folks like to climb down. I took a couple of pictures of the cliff (knowing full well she would want a memory of it as would I).</p>

<p>Then I got her over by the cliffs to take a picture. She wanted to take one of me too. So I went over to the edge and waited. I put my hands in my pocket and felt the box. Something came over me and I pulled it out and opened it while she had the viewfinder up. She let the camera down and asked me what that was as I walked closer to her with the box open. I asked. She said yes.</p>

<p>After we got calmed down and sat down on the rocks, she said "Are you for real?". Heh.</p>

<p>Anyways, I've uploaded some pictures to the gallery. You can get to them <a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/album23">here</a>. YAH!</p>
