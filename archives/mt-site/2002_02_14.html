<span class="title">I don't get viruses damnit!</span>

<p>At least that's what I thought until I walked into work this morning.</p>


<p>Actually I didn't get a virus but when I walked into work this morning, my daily scan from Norton Antivirus assured me that I did.</p>

<p>It seems that the zlib dll that cygwin installs is now the same name as a virus backdoor.</p>

<p>Norton antivirus was happy to quarantine cygz.dll on my behalf, thinking that it was a virus. After assuring myself with a few google searches, I unquarantined the file and went on my merry way.</p>

<p>I'm actually going to fire off an email to both symantec and the cygwin folks about the whole thing.</p>
