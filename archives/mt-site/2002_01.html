<span class="title">Once again proving</span>

<p>that I don't care about the political party but the issue at hand, Rick Boucher (D-VA) has written an excellent article for cnet's news.com.</p>


<p>The article is here:</p>

<p>The MPAA and RIAA both are monopolistic entities that seek to stifle the free market. The DMCA is the tool of those monopolies to restrict Fair Use of material you paid for.</p>

<span class="title">Famous Quotes rock</span>

<p>I love this quote and it was mentioned again on Boston Public lastnight.</p>


<p><i>“Those who would trade freedom for security deserve neither.”</i></p>

<p>People are saying that the government is temporarily suspending our freedoms for security.</p>

<p>The government can't do that. Remember what the declaration of independance says. We were endowed by our creator with certain rights. Until the government  (and more so the people of the United States!) realize that they are only here to defend what our creator has given us and that they don't have the ability nor the right to take them away, we will not get it right.</p>

<p>Sorry about the disconnectedness of the rant but I had to get it out and I seriously needed a break from coding our Disk Imaging software fro the training room.</p>

<p>Back to work! hehe.</p>

<span class="title">Sometimes I hate software vendors.</span>

<p>It seems they go out of thier way to piss of network admins.</p>


<p>Let's take for example one <a href="http://www.webex.com">WebEx</a></p>

<p>This is from <a href="http://www.maxagrid.com/Technical/WebEx/WebExSecurity.html">Maxagrid.com</a>  about the WebEx plugin:</p>

<p><i>When establishing this connection, the client first attempts to connect using TCP port 1270. If this port is blocked by a firewall, the client will tunnel the communications using HTTP port 80. Establishing communications in this manner eliminates the need to reconfigure firewalls to take advantage of the meeting center. This helps ensure compliance with corporate firewall policies for optimal security. The WebEx client is firewall friendly and will work seamlessly with proxy servers and firewall deployments.</i></p>

<p>Note that WebEx will happily tunnel through http if it can't get a direct connection!</p>

<p><b>DAMNIT I DON'T WANT IT TO TUNNEL THROUGH HTTP!</b></p>

<p>I am tired of everyone and his uncle writing applications that will "happily" tunnel through http. I have a network to run. I have my job on the line in relation to security and this network. Why can't these damn companies work WITH firewall developers and not against them? I had the hardest damn time just blocking gnutella and other P2P apps. Now many of the slashdot ilk will tell me  I shouldn't block them but most of those people are 12 and have never worked in a corporate environment much less flipped a burger at the local Arby's.</p>

<p>Understand this software developers. The network of another company is not yours to play around with.  If I have to, I will block every damn class C I find that does this crap. I did it with napster and I did it with the Gnutella hubs and I did it with Musiccity and I'll damn sure block any traffic with squid to any regex that even REMOTLY matches WebEx. It's all I have left to do.</p>

<p>Users. You are at work to (duh!) work. Downloading the latest fucking movie off Morpheus is not your job. That is unless you work for those wanker companies that scan P2P for copyright (what a joke) violations. </p>

<p>Maybe we'll get to the point (aren't we there yet with stateful inspection?) that can block a packet based on the packet itself. I'd love to see that implemented into ipf, pf or iptables at some point. I don't care that I need a beefy box to be my firewall as long as I can say I've done my best to block unwanted traffic.</p>

<p>I guess I'm done now ranting and I still don't feel any better. WebEx, you can blow me and I'm off to write a regex for Squid.<br />

<span class="title">Happy New Year</span>

<p>Another year is upon us,</p>


<p>and I don't feel any different.</p>

<p>I went out to a cool new bar last night for a while. It's called Mazzy's. They have NICE 9 ft pool tables and serve food too. Pretty keen. </p>

<p>I met up with Ned there about 9:30 and we shot pool for about an hour or so while he updated me on all the random shit going on in his life. His divorce. His 2 yr. old daughter.</p>

<p>We left to go to Ben's party around 11ish. There were about 20 people there and we had a good old time. Ben had his mp3 server hooked up to his tv and a nifty little plugin going so all the people could sit and stare ;)</p>

<p>We watched the ball AND the peach drop on split screen. As usual the peach got there first. Champagne was passed around to all and I would gather about 8 or so bottles were finished off. </p>

<p>I didn't drink much myself because I didn't feel like getting wasted as bad as last year. I was more interested in catching up with some people (like Ben) I hadn't talked to in  a few years. </p>

<p>Got home about 2ish and called Michelle up at Almont. We talked for about 45 minutes and I proceded to fall asleep on the couch until the dog decided to wake me up. Guess I drank a bit more than I thought eh?</p>

<p>Happy New Year to all of you and good luck to those of you in Europe switching to the Euro. Maybe it won't be as big a clusterf*ck as everyone thinks it will be ;)</p>
