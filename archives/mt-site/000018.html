<span class="title">About me.</span>

<p>I figured I should put up something about myself to those who happen by my site.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>Well here's the skinny.</p>

<p>My name's John. I'm 27 and live north of the city of Atlanta, GA. I'm your typical geek without the pocket protector and lack of social skills.</p>

<p>I have a dog. Her name is <a href="honey.jpg">Honey</a>. She's 6 years old and I picked her up the Atlanta Humane Society last year. </p>

<p>I'm dating a wonderful woman named Michelle. She lives in Michigan but will be moving down here next year. After all my debacles with online dating shit, I met someone on a Yahoo! group for one of my favorite authors.</p>

<p>I work for a company in Atlanta that does software quality assurance. I don't actually do any of the assurance myself. I just manage the network. I love it, too.</p>

<p>I drive a 2001 Ford Focus. I have an apartment that overlooks the Chattahoochee River. I own three computers and have parts for various other ones in random locations.</p>

<p>I run linux exclusivly and have Windows on a laptop for VPN stuff when I work from home. I also use it to play CivIII when I can.</p>

<p>I have a dvd player, digital cable (internet and tv), surround sound system and a queen sized bed.</p>

<p>In the closet I have a set of turntables and a pair of blue suede shoes.</p>

<p>I drink Guiness, Bass, Harp and Hoegarden with a lemon. (not all at once..at least not in the same glass ;>)</p>

<p>I drink white wines and eat Frosted Mini Wheats for breakfast. (again not at the same time).</p>

<p>I listen to bands like The Deftones, Incubus, Korn, and Cold. I love Courtney Love and Drew Barrymore.(allthough not together...okay well maybe together)</p>

<p>I remember when you could have your uncle or someone bring a gun to school for show and tell. I also remember getting paddled in school.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone is responsible for his own actions and that it is your DUTY to question the government at all times lest we loose our rights.</p>

<p>I am a strict constitutionalist and a libertarian. I believe that Social Security is a Ponzi scam and that the Lottery is a tax on the stupid.</p>

<p>I think all drugs should be legal if only to weed out the weak people. I've used drugs in my past and I'm just fine now and don't do them anymore.</p>

<p>Seems like this turned into more of a screed than anything but I think that about sums it up.</p>
