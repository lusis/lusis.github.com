<p>I almost shat myself when I saw this.</p>


<p>So I'm building a new server and I need to download apache. So I click on the download link and it pops up the suggested mirror site.</p>

<p><br />
http://mirrors.playboy.com/</p>

<p><br />
That's right "Playboy". So I just HAVE to go and take a gander at what the Playboy mirror site looks like.</p>

<p>Like any other opensource mirror site.</p>

<p>Be sure and read the note at the bottom from the playboy.com geeks.</p>

<p>This will probably be one of the fastest mirrors ever because every other corporate customer HAS to have this blocked ;)</p>

<p>Blows my mind....</p>

<span class="title">John Gilmore is at it again</span>

<p><a title="'Suspected terrorist' removed from flight | Metafilter" href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/27098">John Gilmore is raising more hell</a></p>


<p>I&apos;ve been following <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/" title="yes he IS somewhat weird!">John Gilmore</a> for a while. Despite my desire wanting to smack him around for not knowing the difference between a democracy and a federal republic, I was really interested in <a href="http://freetotravel.org/" title="NO TICKET!">his case against the government</a> that requires a picture ID to fly nowadays. At one point, I printed out the entire brief and took it with me on a trip to Michigan hoping to get the Huffman family lawyer to look at it.</p>

<p>I got my email from <a href="http://www.politechbot.com" title="Geeks and Politics">Politech</a> over the weekend. Michelle and I both were a bit flabergasted when I finished reading her the story.</p>

<p>I think the whole thing is just stupid. I also think British Airways might want to retrain the flight crew on the stupidity of thinking that security screener would give a badge to a &quot;suspected terrorist&quot; to identify him.</p>

<p>John Gilmore is actually making a bigger statement with this. Were his civil rights violated? Not in the least.  The real key lies in what he says after discussing things with a BA rep:</p>

<p>&quot;<br />
I asked whether I would be permitted to fly if I wore other buttons,<br />
perhaps one saying &quot;Hooray for Tony Blair&quot;.  She said she thought that<br />
would be OK.<br />
&quot;</p>

<p>People like Sean Hannity, like to rail against opposing speech saying that it's unpatriotic to question authority in a time of war or that it crosses a line at some point. Of ocurse only the active political party can tell you what that line is but let's ignore that.</p>

<p>I also like this part:</p>

<p>&quot;<br />
I told her that it refers to all of us, everyone, being<br />
suspected of being terrorists, being searched without cause, being<br />
queued in lines and pens, forced to take our shoes off, to identify<br />
ourselves, to drink our own breast milk, to submit to indignities.<br />
Everyone is a suspected terrorist in today&apos;s America, including all<br />
the innocent people, and that's wrong.<br />
&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to political correctness, we aren&apos;t allowed to profile criminals because it's racism we are left with the above situation.</p>

<p>I&apos;d also like to point out some misconceptions that Mr. Gilmore has w.r.t. BA. I find some of this rather surprising since he allowed himself to be interview by <a href="http://www.reason.com" title='free minds and free markets">a magazine</a> that is named after something he seems to be missing.</p>

<p>As I&apos;ve said in the past, censorship and freedom of speech ONLY applies to the government in the Constitution. Even then there are some restrictions (of which are common sense restrictions). BA has every right to restrict Mr. Gilmore&apos;s political speech.  This is the other side of free speech - as it relates to individuals. You have freedom of speech but not freedom from consequences. As with the Dixie Chicks, Natalie was perfectly free to say that she was ashamed that the president was from her state but that might come with consequences. In her case, radio stations refused to play her music. That was the freedom of speech the radio stationed exercised. Some people even went off and had mass record burnings. I personally think that was more scary. It is also proof why our government is not a pure democracy and why it is so dangerous.</p>

<p>The second aspect is the guilt by association. Individuals are allowed to make determination as to who the choose to do business with or associate with. In the case of BA, Mr. Gilmore was causing a ruckus (in the minds of the BA team anyway) and thus they might (rightly so) expect the same from his partner. As we know the assumption was wrong in the end but that is a consequence of guilt by association. Look at it this way, if you are being mugged and there is a person who is with the mugger but does not actually do anything wrong, he is still party to the crime. If you were an employer, would you hire someone on the recommendation of an employee you found to be lazy and non-productive? Probably not. You could be wrong but the people we associate with are a direct reflection of who we are.</p>

<p>I think I've done enough ranting for now though. Feel free to comment and tell me I'm wrong. If you find any logical flaws in what I am saying, I would also love to hear it. Either way, I am free to disagree. Gotta love freedom of speech. Works both ways!<br />

<p>In the tradition of providing you with entertaining spam, here is the latest bit of poorly planned email.</p>


<pre>
Hi my name is David DeLanoy from 180Solutions Inc. I am contacting you because 180solutions would like
to bundle
n-CASE, our comparison-alternative shopping engine with your products, such as, Ari's Yahoo Client
1.10.
In return I will work with you to create a revenue package that will increase your monthly revenue.
If you are interested, please give me a call at 425-576-4239 or email me at ddelanoy@180solutions.com.

<p>In regards to distribution, typically the distributors bundle n-CASE in their existing setup programs<br />
or as a part of an upgrade,<br />
and then give their users the option to install n-CASE during setup. Currently over 60% of users opt to<br />
install n-CASE. In<br />
agreement, 180Solutions payes $.07 for every user who opts into installing n-CASE.</p>

<p>What is n-CASE? n-CASE is a Comparative Alternative Shopping Engine that 180Solutions has created to<br />
provide the user with more<br />
direct results in their search process. It is the most widely distributed application of its kind with<br />
over 16 million users worldwide.</p>

<p><br />
If you are interested in even more detailed information about us, please visit our site at:<br />
http://www.180solutions.com/?ref=dtd08</p>

<p><br />
If you are interested in working with us to provide your users with valuable software, as well as help<br />
generate revenue for<br />
your company  please contact me directly so that we can discuss working together. I look forward to<br />
hearing from you.</p>

<p>Respectfully,<br />
David DeLanoy<br />
ddelanoy@180Solutions.com<br />
425-576-4239<br />
</pre></p>

<p>Now showing that spammers and spyware creators are cut from the same cloth, David wants to do business with me!</p>

<p>A few points for David DeLanoy:</p>

<p>1) I'm just the technical contact for the domain where Ari's site is hosted. If you weren't just spamming whois records, you might know that.</p>

<p>2) Ari's Yahoo Client is a linux based product. Have you been so kind as to port your spyware to linux? Also, since Ari's Yahoo Client is under the GPL, you are aware that integrating your code would require that it be distributed under the selfsame license? I guess Ari, as original license grantor, could create a dual-license but it WOULD be interesting to get the source for some of this spyware to disable it.</p>

<p>3) This is a CONSOLE based program. What exactly are you spying on from the console? "My god Jim, this guy is running a screen session and an ssh session, let's send him an ad for tampons!"</p>

<p>Silly idiots. Don't bother the nice people.</p>

<p><i>In a related story, Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Ill are currently in a proverbial cold war over who has rights to the name "Megatron." Jong Ill clearly defined his postion in a recent press statment, saying directly to Mr. Hussein, "I knew Megatron and let me tell you something, Saddam. You are no Megatron. Starscream, sure, maybe even Galvatron, but Megatron? Nope, not going to happen."</i></p>

<p>Michelle sent this to me. Now that I've bothered to set up bookmarklets for publishing new entries, I can simply hit a button and upload a new link for all to see in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>I could do that before but this is so much easier.<br />

<p>That's the latest weekly column on worldnetdaily from Boortz. It's suprisingly non-partisan and while limited in scope,  it's his common difference with the LP right now.  I'm guessing there are a few of us libertarians out there right now who feel the same way.</p>

<p>Here are a few links I've found from various sources. </p>


<p>I've decided to at least provide some links daily even if I can't entertain you with my witty banter. </p>

<p>By the way, does anyone OTHER than my family actually read this damn site? It's more of a personal journal for me than anything. Isn't that all blogs really are? A distributed forum? People respond to blogs from other sources all the time. <a href="nataliesolent.blogspot.com">Natalie Solent</a> comments on <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog">Samizdata</a> or <a href="http://www.instapundit.com">Instapundit</a>. <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> links to <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a> (although k5 would never link to a /. story ;>).</p>

<p>Blogging is like some sort of inbred family reunion. In the end, everyone is related to someone else.</p>

<p>Oh yeah....the links:<br />
<a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20030220-19499864.htm">Walter Williams gets it right</a></p>

and he showed me <a href="http://blogstreet.com/visualneighborhood.html">this</a>. Too bad I'm not in there!</p>

<p>Speaking of Doc, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">LinuxJournal this month talks about blogs</a></p>

<p>I get alot of spam. I mean alot. But sometimes I get a spam that makes me wonder WHAT in the hell someone was thinking?</p>


<p>This came to me via K5. When I say via K5, i mean some stupid bot scoured kuro5hin and snagged my email address.</p>

<p>This is why I have my own domain. I can use a different email for whatever the occasion.</p>

<p>Today's occasion is leeches. Or at least that's what some kind soul in Russia wants me to read about:</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I am a doctor hirudotherapeutist and I use medicine leeches which I buy at biofactory.I am specialised in treating with leeches.I'm a member of<br />
Association of hirudotherapeutists of Russia.All leeches have the<br />
sertification of guality.You may look through my site.It will explaine you<br />
the problem.I am worning for almost 6 years.In all given examples in site I<br />
used leeches for treatment.</p>

<p>My site:home.mariupol.net/~valery</p>

<p>With best regards,<br />
</pre></p>

<p>I've taken a bit of care with the people cc'd on this email. I masked all but the funny addresses. What I mean by funny is email addresses that were created SPECIFICALLY to avoid spam. I'm guessing it did the job because the attempted to mail the false addresses anyway.</p>

<p>I will give poor Valery credit, it's the most targetted bit of junk mail I've ever gotten. I VAGUELY remember participating in such a discussion on K5 at some point allthough my endless searching has turned up no such details.</p>

<span class="title">Larry Wall interview</span>

<p>Slashdot did an interview with Larry Wall, the guy who created Perl and it rocks.</p>


<p>Sort of continuing the thread I started yesterday about religion, I thought I would paste a bit from the interview here:<br />
<b><br />
7) Role of Religion?<br />
by Anonymous Cowdog<br />
</b><br />
<i><br />
I remember reading at some point that you are a Christian, and there have been suggestions that some of your early missionary impulses (a desire to do good, help others) are perhaps part of the zeal you have put into Perl over the years.</p>

<p>Preferring a scientific view, I am not religious, and have no desire to be. Perhaps there is a God, but if there is, I think he/she has no opposable thumbs; in other words, has no power to change anything; reality is just playing out according to the laws of physics (whatever those are).</p>

<p>Please tell us how in the world a scientific or at least technical mind can believe in God, and what role religion has played in your work on Perl.<br />
</i><br />
<b>A:</b><br />
<i><br />
Well, hmm, that's a topic for an entire essay, or a book, or a life. But I'll try to keep it short.</p>

<p>When you say ""how in the world"", I take it to mean that you find it more or less inconceivable that someone with a scientific mind (or at least technical mind, hah!) could chooose to believe in God. I'd like to at least get you to the point where you find it conceivable. I expect a good deal of the problem is that you are busy disbelieving a different God than the one I am busy believing in. In theological discussions more than any other kind, it's easy to talk at right angles and never even realize it.</p>

<p>So let me try to clarify what I mean, and reduce it to as few information bits as possible. A lot of people have a vested interest in making this a lot tougher to swallow than it needs to be, but it's supposed to be simple enough that a child can understand it. It doesn't take great energetic gobs of faith on your part--after all, Jesus said you only have to have faith the size of a mustard seed. So just how big is that, in information theory terms? I think it's just two bits big. Please allow me to qoute a couple "bits" from Hebrews, slightly paraphrased:</p>

<p>You can't please God the way Enoch did without some faith, because those who come to God must (minimally) believe that:<br />
    A) God exists, and<br />
    B) God is good to people who really look for him.</p>

<p>That's it. The "good news" is so simple that a child can understand it, and so deep that a philosopher can't.</p>

<p>Now, it appears that you're willing to admit the possibility of bit A being a 1, so you're almost halfway there. Or maybe you're a quarter way there on average, if it's a qubit that's still flopping around like Shoedinger's Cat. You're the observer there, not me--unless of course you're dead. :-)</p>

<p>A lot of folks get hung up at point B for various reasons, some logical and some moral, but mostly because of Shroedinger again. People are almost afraid to observe the B qubit because they don't want the wave function to collapse either to a 0 or a 1, since both choices are deemed unpalatable. A lot of people who claim to be agnostics don't take the position so much because they don't know, but because they don't want to know, sometimes desperately so.</p>

<p>Because if it turns out to be a 0, then we really are the slaves of our selfish genes, and there's no basis for morality other than various forms of tribalism.</p>

<p>And because if it turns out to be a 1, then you have swallow a whole bunch of flim-flam that goes with it. Or do you?</p>

<p>Let me admit to you that I came at this from the opposite direction. I grew up in a religious culture, and I had to learn to "unswallow" an awful lot of stuff in order to strip my faith down to these two bits.</p>

<p>I tried to strip it down further, but I couldn't, because God told me: "That's far enough. I already flipped your faith bits to 1, because I'm a better Observer than you are. You are Shroedinger's cat in reverse--you were dead spiritually, but I've already examined the qubits for you, and I think they're both 1. Who are you to disagree with me?"</p>

<p>So, who am I to disagree with God? :-) If he really is the Author of the universe, he's allowed to observe the qubits, and he's probably even allowed to cheat occasionally and force a few bit flips to make it a better story. That's how Authors work. Whether or not they have thumbs...</p>

<p>Once you see the universe from that point of view, many arguments fade into unimportance, such as Hawking's argument that the universe fuzzed into existence at the beginning, and therefore there was no creator. But it's also true that the Lord of the Rings fuzzed into existence, and that doesn't mean it doesn't have a creator. It just means that the creator doesn't create on the same schedule as the creature's.</p>

<p>If God is creating the universe sideways like an Author, then the proper place to look for the effects of that is not at the fuzzy edges, but at the heart of the story. And I am personally convinced that Jesus stands at the heart of the story. The evidence is there if you care to look, and if you don't get distracted by the claims of various people who have various agendas to lead you in every possible direction, and if you don't fall into the trap of looking for a formula rather than looking for God as a person. All human institutions are fallible, and will create a formula for you to determine whether you belong to the tribe or not. Very often these formulas are called doctrines and traditions and such, and there is some value in them, as there is some value in any human culture. But they all kind of miss the point.</p>

<p>"Systematic theology" is an oxymoron. God is not a system. Christians are fond of asking: "What would Jesus do in this situation?" Unfortunately, they very rarely come up with the correct answer, which is: "Something unexpected!" If the Creator really did write himself into his own story, that's what we ought to expect to see. Creative solutions.</p>

<p>And this creativity is intended to be transitive. We are expected to be creative. And we're expected to help others be creative.</p>

<p>And that leads us back (finally) to the last part of your question, how all this relates to Perl.</p>

<p>Perl is obviously my attempt to help other people be creative. In my little way, I'm sneakily helping people understand a bit more about the sort of people God likes.</p>

<p>Going further, we have the notion that a narrative should be defined by its heart and not by its borders. That ties in with my linguistic notions that things ought to be defined by prototype rather than by formula. It ties in to my refusal to define who is or is not a "good" Perl programmer, or who exactly is or isn't a member of the "Perl community". These things are all defined by their centers, not by their peripheries.</p>

<p>The philosophy of TMTOWTDI ("There's more than one way to do it.") is a direct result of observing that the Author of the universe is humble, and chooses to exercise control in subtle rather than in heavy-handed ways. The universe doesn't come with enforced style guidelines. Creative people will develop style on their own. Those are the sort of people that will make heaven a nice place.</p>

<p>And finally, there is the underlying conviction that, if you define both science and religion from their true centers, they cannot be in confict. So despite all the "religiosity" of Perl culture, we also believe in the benefits of computer science. I didn't put lexicals and closures into Perl 5 just because I thought people would start jumping up and down and shouting "Hallelujah!" (Which happens, but that's not why I did it.)</p>

<p>And now let's all sing hymn #42... <br />
</i></p>

<p>This is some deep stuff that any geek can understand and appreciate.  The interesting thing is that Larry isn't trying to win any converts with this statement. Someone asked him a justification for his faith and he gave it.</p>

<p>It's a good read overall.</p>

<p>Check out the entire interview <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/06/1343222&mode=thread&tid=145">here</a>.<br />
 There's quite a few technical discussions involved about Perl (which some of you may not give a rat's ass) but the whole thing is pretty neat to sit through.</p>

<p>I actually found something valuable from fuckedcompany.com.</p>


<p>Check this post out:<br />
<a href="http://www.postget.com/get/article.php?newsid=90507">Corporate Communism</a></p>

<p>It's an interesting read and somewhat of a eye-opener for me. I had this mindset that capitalism was the perfect system. I don't feel that way anymore. </p>

<p>Note this quote from the article:<br />
<i>But while capitalism is the best system, it isn't a perfect system.</i></p>

<p>I thought about that line for a minute. I can see flaws in capitalism. Check this quote:</p>

<p><i>Left unfettered, what starts slowly as the many fit swallowing the many weak, continues like a snowball, without stopping until a very few bloated giants are left standing. Over time, companies are able to leverage small advantages into humongous advantages. That's why anti-trust laws were created to begin with.</i></p>

<p> Without competition, companies have no reason to improve. With competition, the consumer is the ultimate winner.</p>

<p>I never really reconciled the Sherman Act with my personal feelings on capitalism. I understood it fully and what it was intended to do but never made that tiny link. Today, after reading this article, something clicked.</p>

<p>The natural course of capitalism is that eventually you are left with a monopoly. Those are not illegal as long as competition still has room to thrive. After all, by nature and definition of competition is that someone is that someone comes out on top. Good sportsmanship aside, there is a winner.</p>

<p>As long as the winner is willing to accept new challenges and play fair, capitalism works. The reason we needed the anti-trust laws is that the winner decided he didn't like the rules that allowed him to become the winner.</p>

<p>Read the article. While it's about a specific situation, it has truths that apply to anyone that believes in the power of a free market and the right of the individual to decide for himself.</p>

<span class="title">Blame Canada!</span>

<p>I found this link from an Ultima Online newsgroup.</p>


<p>It's about a guy named Gord who runs a video game store. Based on what people had said in the newsgroup, I figured it was a work of fiction but as they say, "Truth is stranger than fiction".</p>

<p>There's quite a bit of political commentary in there as well. I'm guessing that Gord isn't to happy with the nice socialist setup Canada has. </p>

<p>I wouldn't mind if someone from Canada could explain some of the legal things to me. I'm guessing that because Canada has such a strong welfare program, they give business the power they need to collect debts from credit risks? Or is this just standard business?</p>

<p>Anyway here's the link:<br />

<p>I found a seriously cool site today.<br />
</p>


<p>It's called <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com">Brainy Quote</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite that I've read thus far is this one by Thomas Jefferson:</p>

<p><i>"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government. "</i></p>

<p>I'll be adding some to my random quotes section as I go through them.</p>

<p>Rock on.</p>

<span class="title">Interesting</span>

<p>I found this link from an article on slashdot.</p>


<p>It's a site called <a href="http://www.yourcongress.com/">yourcongress.com</a>.</p>

<p>One of the interesting things it has is a "power rating" for each member of congress. This is made up of committee membership among other things.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yourcongress.com/profile.asp?member_id=105">Zell Miller</a> is a 95 out of 100.</p>

<p>The other neato feature is that you can track a rep on his voting issues.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>

<p>I got this from monster.com (I really should just stop the job agent emails). Of note is the part about VNC integration with a web enabled application. What the hell is that all about? Custom workplace desktops via the web? Didn't the dot bombs already try this? Besides VNC is already integrated. It's called a java applet.</p>
