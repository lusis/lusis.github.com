<span class="title">Finally someone gets it right!</span>

<p>"Looks like Be/Palm finally got off the collective ass and did the right thing.</p>

<p>Finally something as verifiable proof that Microsoft abused its monopoly. The BeOS bootloader issue is one of the biggest smoking guns (in my book) ever regarding the issue. Read about it on the link above.<br />

<span class="title">Postfix is now running</span>

<p>I finally got postfix all configured.</p>


<p>I've got the rules pretty tight on what can and can't get through. If you get any information about mail getting rejected for whatever reason, forward it to postmaster at lusis.org.</p>

<p>I've stopped short of subscribing to an RBL list. I want to see how much spam I can block by stopping things like servers that don't have a valid HELO client name or whatnot. Again if anyone who has an email account on the server is having problems, just drop me a line.  I'll also accept sample configs from various people that might have example access files and main.cf's that have been succesful in blocking the majority of UCE. I'll be glad to post them here for others to download as well.<br />

<span class="title">Sendmail stuff</span>

<p>Sendmail sucks</p>


<p>I've been f'ing around with sendmail to make some spam changes. I might or might not have messed up the mailserver. All this in light of my nifty post on slashdot. Actually it's just some virtual user stuff. If any of my users have any problem getting mail or mail showing up in the from field to other people, let me know. I'll take a whack at fixing it.</p>

<p>Update: Sendmail sucks so much I'm going to install postfix tonight. Mail services will be down for a bit whilst I do all that.</p>

<span class="title">I don't get viruses damnit!</span>

<p>At least that's what I thought until I walked into work this morning.</p>


<p>Actually I didn't get a virus but when I walked into work this morning, my daily scan from Norton Antivirus assured me that I did.</p>

<p>It seems that the zlib dll that cygwin installs is now the same name as a virus backdoor.</p>

<p>Norton antivirus was happy to quarantine cygz.dll on my behalf, thinking that it was a virus. After assuring myself with a few google searches, I unquarantined the file and went on my merry way.</p>

<p>I'm actually going to fire off an email to both symantec and the cygwin folks about the whole thing.</p>

<span class="title">Gotta love IBM</span>

<p>"Why would someone that good, play for nothing?"</p>


<p>"Because he loves the game. He loves the game"</p>

<p>Basically the commercial is a bunch of guys playing basketball. On each person's uniform is a name like "wireless" or "web" or "ecommerce".</p>

<p>The coach introduces the newest teamate "Linux" to the team. He procedes to pull a MJ (pre-Washington Wizards Jordon) and dunk all over the place. The quotes above are from a meeting that two guys are having about the new guy.</p>

<p>I have to tell you this is the best commercial for linux yet. "The Hiest" was cool and all but this really smacks it to the PHB's saying that something free can't be any good.</p>

<p>Rock on IBM!</p>
