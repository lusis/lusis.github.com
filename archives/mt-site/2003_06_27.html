<p>Michelle and I just finished a rousing game of "War Cribbage"<br />
</p>


<p>It&#8217;s fun too! Basically it started out one night when I whupped up on Michelle after dinner. I think it was my first double skunk. We started messing around with the cards and playing cribbage in the same style as war.</p>

<p>Tonight we refined the game to it's ultimate version - A DRINKING GAME!</p>

<p>Here's how it works. Each person needs a deck. For Christmas, along with my new Cribbage Board, I got a NICE twin pack of <a href="http://www.kem.com" title="Best Cards - EVER">Kem&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>You reset your pegs to start. Each person takes a deck and you start. It's not as fast paced as war but it's just as fun.</p>

<p>- Take turns flipping cards - War Style.<br />
- Any points scored during play (15s, runs, pairs), forces the looser to drink while the winner counts out the number of points.<br />
e.g. Michelle plays 6, I play 7, she plays an 8. I now have to drink while she counts to 3. She doesn&#8217;t want to count TOO slow because if I lay down a 5, it&#8217;s going to be the longest 4 seconds she's ever known ;)<br />
- 31 only counts for a point and only a quick drink is required. That also gives you a point on the board.<br />
- A bust ( going over 31 ) is also a point. As before, looser only has to take a quick swig on a single point.<br />
- After each hand (31 points or bust), the cards are moved off to your own side in case you need to recycle.<br />
- Nobs are a bit unique. It works this way:<br />
  Nobs are only awarded when a jack is played that matches the suit of the previously played card. Since each person has their own desk, It&#8217;s POSSIBLE to have each person after the first get nobs (A - Ace of clubs, B- Jack of clubs, C - Jack of clubs, D - Jack of clubs &lt;and 31 for 2 more points&gt;)<br />
- The game is over when one person gets 30 points ( on my board - an up/down not a race track style - that&#8217;s the top of the lane. )</p>

<p>If you have any questions, email me and I&#8217;ll be glad to explain the rules a bit better. If you come up with any variations or other similar games (war euchre for instance), I&#8217;ll be glad to post them.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Interesting article cowritten by the founder of <a href="http://www.cato.org" title="The Cato Institute">The Cato Institute</a> and its chairman. I&apos;m still digging for an interesting article that Michelle sent me about a sort of NeoCon cabal involving Wolfie, Cheney and a few others. I&apos;m now starting to agree with some people that Bush was handpicked because of his name and maliability to the whims of some extreme right-wing (god I hate phrases like that) politicals. </p>

<p>Make no mistake people, the Republicans are no more interested in limited Federal government than the Dems are.</p>
