<p>It seems I forgot to change the mailserver setting when I copied my mt stuff over to the new server. </p>


<p>I've actually gotten comments and didn't even know it. Of course I've so busy on this webapp I've been creating that I haven't had time to do much else. That's fixed now. If you leave comments, I'll know and read them.</p>

<p>Michelle has been very supportive. I'm still with the company that was supposed to be closing up in June.  I knew I wouldn't be around after things finished so I've been happy to have any extra days (months even!). I really feel for the people who are going to be around afterwards  because of all the indetermination.</p>

<p>I also interviewed with a company that decided not to hire me because they though I was a windows guy. I'm still trying to figure out who they interviewed because it wasn't me.</p>

<p>FYI: new pictures:<br />
<a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/J-n-J-Wedding/" title="Jon and Jaime's wedding pictures">The Wedding (not mine!)</a></p>

<p>This is Michelle's brother and his new wife. The wedding was awesome and I got to takes notes (or was ordered to take notes =P). Since Michelle and I are getting married on the beach, some things didn't translate so well though. I was also a lector as well. </p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, you can see a picture of me and Michelle from  right before while we were getting ready.</p>

<p><a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/J-n-J-Wedding/aan" title="aww cute!">Michelle and I</a>. Get this, she caught the bouquet. I just sat there and said "She's the next to get married? No crap!"</p>

<p>Anyways, that's the status update. I'm going to go back to working on my small business software and drown myself in php.</p>
