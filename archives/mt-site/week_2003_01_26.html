<p>Well it was interesting and a bit horror movie-ish but one thing scared me more than anything else.</p>


<p>The person chosen to stay out in case of attack was John Ashcroft. That's a hell of alot scarier than Saddam Hussein and Vx nerve gas.</p>

<p>I told Michelle:<br />
"That's scary. I wonder where he falls on the "Everyone else got blowed up" tree.</p>

<p>Discuss and have trouble sleeping amongst yourselves when you think about John Ashcroft as President.</p>

<p>Interesting note on politechbot about spam.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04371.html">Here is the original</a></p>

<p>What I find interesting is the section about azgoogle and the numbers that come up:</p>

<p><i>2. I blocked all traffic from the well-known spammers at azoogle.com<br />
nearly a year ago.  My mail servers return the correct response codes to<br />
every SMTP connection from them, indicating that access has been permanently<br />
denied; the text message which accompanies it indicates why.  However,<br />
they're still pounding away multiple times per day, every day, on every<br />
mail server I have.  A small sample of abridged log entries from the<br />
last 24 hours:</p>

<p>Jan 19 16:49:03 sendmail: arg1=transport23b.azoogle.com, <br />
arg2=66.197.140.226, reject=550 5.0.0<br />
Jan 19 17:23:41 sendmail: arg1=transport23e.azoogle.com, <br />
arg2=66.197.140.229, reject=550 5.0.0<br />
Jan 20 09:06:19 sendmail: arg1=transport12c.azoogle.com, <br />
arg2=66.197.140.72, reject=550 5.0.0</p>

<p>I have 12,814 more log entries just like that in my archives.<br />
</i></p>

<p>It happens to me as well. The response code I return is always permanently rejected and yet host after host says screw you and keeps trying to send mail. See <a href="http://www.lusis.org/mt/lusis/archives/2002_04.html#000044">here</a> for an example.</p>

<p>Maybe this is where someone needs to test the legal waters and sue using the DoS argument.  Or hell even plain-jane theft of resources. What about harrasment charges?</p>

<p>Think about it. If my mailserver says "No. I do not wish to accept mail from you EVER again.", how is it different from an ex-whatever filing for a restraining order? Maybe we need digital restraining orders of some sort.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/forms/printThis.html?id=110002965">Zell Miller does an editorial</a> for WSJ OpinionJournal and I weep that we're loosing him.</p>


<p>Zell hits the nail on the head in this one. It seems he understands that you can't reduce taxes without reducing government spending. If I'm expected and encouraged to budget and plan financially, why in the hell shouldn't the Federal Government?</p>

<p>UPDATE:<br />
You should also read <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/1750552"> this article</a> to see some numbers and see that the problem is the fault of both Dems and Repubs.</p>
