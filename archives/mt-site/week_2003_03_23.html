<span class="title">Gilmore gets it WRONG</span>

<p>Well during my daily reading of cryptome, I found that the main link was in reagards to the U.S. media not showing the video and pictures of the POW's who were killed in Iraq.</p>


<p>I didn't realize that it actually had screengrabs. I'm a bit freaked out. Gilmore gets one thing wrong though. And being such a big point that he got wrong, I've lost alot of respect for him.</p>

<p>He signs the page with "Yours against censorship". He seems to think that the footage not being shown on US airwaves is one of censorship. It was not. I suggest he go and read up on what censorship is. Censorship is created by governments, not private businesses and organizations.</p>

<p>Is it censorship for me, as a private business owner, to not allow you to wear a shirt with some random message on it? No.</p>

<p>Is it censorship for the police to forbid you from saying or publishing the selfsame message? Yes. </p>

<p>The news media were asked by the administration NOT to air the footage. The networks were under no state restriction to hold it back.</p>

<p>The honored that request out of respect for families that might not have been notified that thier son or daughter was KIA. How would you like to see your brother or sister lying dead on the ground with a hole in the forehead while the jackass with the gun is standing there gloating? You wouldn't. Now imagine that being broadcast on national television. See the point?</p>

<p>Mr. Gilmore, you got it wrong sir. I feel for you not being able to see the difference. If your opposition to this conflict removes your respect for your fellow man, then you've lost your way.</p>

<p>It's only two pages but it approaches certain aspects of this case that I agree and disagree with.</p>

<p>There's an attempt to argue states rights (something I'm in favor of) and community-dictated standards.</p>

<p>The other side is that if this appeal is lost, it opens up the door to all sorts of government nosiness in the bedrooms of millions of americans. It also makes mention of a case I was unfamiliar with that involved an inter-racial relationship.</p>

<p>It started to get REALLY good right before the transcript was cut short.</p>

<p><i>JUSTICE STEPHEN G. BREYER But the argument of Bowers, to overrule Bowers, is not directly related to sodomy. It's related, but not directly. It's that people in their own bedrooms, which have their right to do basically what they want, it's not hurting other people. And they, the other side, says Bowers understated the importance of that. It got the history wrong. It didn't understand the relationship of the sodomy to families, and, in addition, Bowers has proved to be harmful to thousands and thousands and thousands of people, if not because they're going to be prosecuted, because they fear it, they might be, which makes it a possible instrument of repression in the hands of the prosecutors. Now, that's the kind of argument that they're making. Harmful in consequence, wrong in theory, understating the constitutional value.</i></p>

<p>One of the arguments is that this indirectly discrimates based on sexual preference because now couples who have engaged in a private act in the confines of private property are now labled as criminals because they have a record.</p>

<p>Anyone know where I can get a rolling transcript or do I have to wait for the close of the day?</p>

<p>The least DC can do is send a response to the mail when it's rejected for chrissakes. This isn't so much of a problem with mail filtering as it is with the specifics used at DC.</p>

<p>At our office, when an email is rejected for content reasons, the sender knows it. Whether it's blocked by the SBL (which gives an SMTP error that any sender will see) or the antivirus box kicks back a message saying why the message was rejected.</p>

<p>I'm really curious as to what system the DC folks are even using.</p>

<p>I've updated my file. I added:</p>

<pre>
IFRAME[SRC*="/html.ng"]  { display: none ! important }</pre>

<p>under the iframe section. It was already listed up under the IMG SRC entries but not for iframes. </p>

<p>The main reason for this is that stratics forums uses mediamgr.ugo.com for alot of the ads and the site runs DOG SLOW.</p>

<p>When are people going to realize that text ads work much better. People are assuming stratics forums are slow when the real problem is off-site third party banner ads!</p>

<p>Another update: I've found a link that discusses where mozilla stores it's profiles for each OS. Alot of people have asked me where in the hell to actually put the userContent.css file.</p>

<p>This is straight from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.0/#profiles">mozilla.org:</a></p>

<p>Profile Locations<br />

<p>I finally got around to actually READING an article on the whole dolphin thing. Check it out. It's really cool.</p>

<p>I honestly thought they used the dolphins to set the mines off. Seemed like such a waste. These guys are trained, not only to find mines, but also drop tethers and swim back to the ships and push buttons.</p>

<p>The Navy also has sea lions and two white whales. ROCK ON!</p>

<A href="http://www.goats.com/">Goats</a> has this update -</p>

<p><i>In a related story, Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Ill are currently in a proverbial cold war over who has rights to the name "Megatron." Jong Ill clearly defined his postion in a recent press statment, saying directly to Mr. Hussein, "I knew Megatron and let me tell you something, Saddam. You are no Megatron. Starscream, sure, maybe even Galvatron, but Megatron? Nope, not going to happen."</i></p>

<span class="title">Help for a troubled web browser</span>

<p>People have been griping on the stratics forums about the banner ads now that customers have been forced to go there for support. I humbly offer these tips to help everyone.</p>


<p>1) Download <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">mozilla.</a></p>

<p>2) Download <a href="http://www.lusis.org/static/userContent.css">file</a>. I've added some changes for flash ads. If anyone can get the yahoo flash ads as well, let me know and I'll integrate the changes. They use some javascript funkyness.</p>

<p>3) Put it in the appropriate directory. It goes into the chrome directory for your profile. Check <a href="http://www.flii.us/myworks/phoenix/pages/chrome.html">this site</a> for an example. It's uses the phoenix directory but replace  Phoenix in the examples with Mozilla.</p>

<p>4) Browse the web snappy-like!</p>

<p>Yet another non-partisan article about the current "conflict" (okay it's a war) in Iraq. It strikes me as slightly anti-semetic but maybe I'm just used to seeing that in the world today?</p>

<p>That's the latest weekly column on worldnetdaily from Boortz. It's suprisingly non-partisan and while limited in scope,  it's his common difference with the LP right now.  I'm guessing there are a few of us libertarians out there right now who feel the same way.</p>
