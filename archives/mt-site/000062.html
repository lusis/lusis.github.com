<span class="title">Screenshot - Antialiased and all</span>

<p>I'm just so proud that all the compiling finished that I had to take a screenshot.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>Here's the lowdown. I got tired of my current look. I really wanted AA fonts in Mozilla. After a few false starts, I basically recompiled EVERYTHING from source off the redhat 8 SRPM cd's. There were a few hiccups along the way but when I was finished, I had a nice new install of Gnome2 complete with AA fonts all over the place. </p>

<p>I'm using 1.2b since Moz recalled on 1.2final. As soon as it's out again, I'll build it.</p>

<p>The fonts on my desktop are all fancy because I wanted them to be. The title bar fonts are a little LESS fancy. The actual application font is good old arial.</p>

<p>I recompiled my kernel with the latest ck patches (ck-15) and enabled low-latency and preempt. I built EVERYTHING with "-O3 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer". I figured those were nice safe flags. Since I'm still using gcc-2.96 I can't take advantage of the other fancy stuff that gcc3 has to offer. </p>

<p>The only thing I left as normal was xterm. I'm using a nice solid vga font. I can't deal with AA in a term window. It just doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips about dual running gcc296 and gcc3 on RH7.3 I'd be glad to hear it. The only reason I can't move to RH8.0 fully is a naughty bug in Kapital, which I use to manage my finances. As soon as The Kompany gets that fixed, I'm good to go though. Yes, I even tried recompiling Kapital but the bug is still there. Methinks it's a bug with QT/KDE that RedHat uses on 8.0.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here are the links to everything I used and did. Oh yeah and that handy screenshot! Any questions, shoot me an email - articles at lusis dot org</p>

<p>Random Notes:<br />
- I have two checking accounts, a savings account and a credit card account and all 4 work flawlessly in Mozilla. Rock on!<br />
- I put both filetypes on the screenshots. Are there any browsers in use that DON'T support PNG properly?<br />
- The focus is all wack in the screenshots because the gnome screenshot application takes all focus when in use. Thus no active title bars in the shot<br />
- The themes I use for Metacity and Gtk2 are LighthouseBlue. It was created by Jar in response to comments from Eugenia Loli-Queru at OSNews.com on her review of RedHat 8.0<br />
- I can build RH7.3 compliant SRPMS of everything if anyone is interested.<br />
- The song I was listening to on xmms was "Twist" by Korn. Yes I own "Life is Peachy" so bite me RIAA.<br />
- Total build time without stupid hiccups on my part ( changing build archs hardcoded into various SRPMS) was around 3 days. Let's just say I didn't use my machine much and spent alot of time on the laptop ;) It was worth it though.</p>
