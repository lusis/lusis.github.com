<p>Okay I'm done!</p>


<p>Everything has been migrated (by hand no less!) to the MovableType engine.</p>

<p>I'm using the default layout right now. I'll spend some time this weekend creating a better "skin" for everything.</p>

<p>The old site is still accesable <a href="http://www.lusis.org/index.nuke.php">here</a> but it won't be updated. All entries will be here now.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lusis.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=gallery&file=index">gallery </a> is still there as well but the URL *WILL* be changing soon.</p>

<span class="title">Moving to MovableType</span>

<p>For speed sake, I've decided to move over to MoveableType.</p>


<p>Postnuke was overkill for what I was doing. I love php and I love Postnuke but I figured this would be a better solution.</p>

<p>I'm a tinkerer. Always have been. I once ruined a clockradio by taking it apart then cutting the ends off the plug and sticking the individual wires in the socket.</p>

<p>Turns out a fuse had blown but I was only 9 so I had no clue. More fuses were blown after I was done with it.</p>

<p>I'll be migrating the stories over as soon as I can. Blogging is such a bad habit! And a bad word for that matter.</p>
