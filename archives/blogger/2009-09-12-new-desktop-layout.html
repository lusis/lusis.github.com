I really liked the darker colors and the Conky config. I was also enjoying how simply and quick everything was.  What really got me was that I found quite a few new apps that I didn't know existed (for instance Gwibber).<br /><br />I decided to try and do something similar with a little bit more flare on the desktop side. These screenshots are the result. The first is with terminator up. The sceond is just the desktop.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-3377867720379186750?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
