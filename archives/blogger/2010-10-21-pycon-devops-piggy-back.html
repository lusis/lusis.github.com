So I had a random idea the other night and like any other random idea I immediately sent it to Twitter.<br /><br />This of course brought feedback which is the whole point, right?<br /><br />The idea was to have a Velocity style conference in the South East. We all know my love for <a href="http://sweetteamanifesto.com/">Atlanta</a> and my half-disdain/half-jealousy of the West coast. So I threw the idea out on twitter and immediately got my first reply from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/heckj">Joe Heck</a> with a bit of reality thrown in:<div><br /></div><div><blockquote>@lusis nice idea. critical mass with either be easy or impossible to get. You might consider riffing on existing conferences ... PyCon2011</blockquote></div><div><br /></div><div>Awesome idea so I headed off to to read up on how PyCon does that kind of thing. I shot off an email to the pycon-organizers mailing list and got some really nice responses. I also got a private tweets from people on the list as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>The end result is this. If I want to hitchhike on the back of PyCon for a devops-related conference, here are the requirements/suggestions:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Involve Python in some way</li><li>Will need to take advantage of the Open Spaces system</li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>This essentially means unless I (or someone else) is giving a full blown talk on Python and DevOps, it will be an ad-hoc thing. We can't reserve the spaces until the day of the conference. I'm also not sure how big the spaces are. I think this is the same place LISA was held years ago so you might be able to snag a dividable room segment?</div><div><br /></div><div>So what does everyone think? I'm considering giving a talk on the state of devops toolchains in Python (func, cobbler, fabric, kokki, overmind, whatever else) but I don't know that I'm ready for that yet after a single LUG presentation ;)</div><div><br /></div><div>I know that Mitchell H. of Vagrant fame was considering heading into town for it. Vagrant isn't just for Rubyists ;)</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm open to ideas. I'd love to just have the conference I sent the tweet about but when I really think about it, I don't think I can pull something like that off in this amount of time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Many thanks to the pycon-organizers folks for the input - Doug Hellmann, Vern Ceder and Jesse Noller. Also to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ponderings">Dean Goodmanson</a> for his feedback via Twitter.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-2263586710429905117?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
