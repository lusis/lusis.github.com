I saw something interesting pop up on twitter:<br /><br />http://code.google.com/p/nagios-was/<br /><br />that made me think of my websphere monitoring work:<br /><br />http://bit.ly/I6YUw<br /><br />Admittedly, mine isn't actually a Nagios plugin but I could pretty easily convert it to one. The logic is all there. Maybe I'll download a trial version of WAS6 (mine was written again V5) and see if I can make it an actual plugin.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-3967523710155915355?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
