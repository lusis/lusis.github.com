<h1 id="monitoring-sucks---round-2---fight">Monitoring sucks - Round 2 - FIGHT</h1><p>Recently there’s been more and more attention to the whole ##monitoringsucks campaign. Peopel are writing blog posts. Code is being written. Discussions are being had. Smart people are doing smart things.</p><h2 id="meetingssuck">meetingssuck</h2><p>I figure it’s time to get the band back together for another official irc session and stop flooding infra-talk with random rants about where things stand. As much as I hate to even consider it, I think having something of an agenda so that it doesn’t turn into a bitch fest.</p><p>I’m open to any ideas that people have.</p><p>Jordan Sissel brought up some things that might be nice to have:</p><ul><li>use cases</li><li>primitives</li></ul><p>I’d like to also love to get input from others before we settle on the details. This one is going to be a bit more “formal” than the first session. Don’t let that turn you off. Everyone has something valuable to contribute.</p><h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2><p>I can’t believe I’m actually suggesting this part but I’d also love to walk away with something that people can work with. It’s not like people will have homework or a task list.</p><p>This is more of a “this is what we would like to see, if you want to write some code it’s a decent place to start”.</p><h2 id="international-flavor">International flavor</h2><p>I’m also keen on finding a time when we can get as many folks as possible to contribute. This may not be possible with that whole rotation of the earth thing but we’ll see.</p><h1 id="suggestions-comments-and-rude-remarks">Suggestions, Comments and Rude Remarks</h1><p>If you’ve got anything you’d like to see or contribute on the planning side, drop me a message on IRC, email or twitter and I’ll include it (if possible) when I draft up the final “notes” beforehand.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-6597763775292665798?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
