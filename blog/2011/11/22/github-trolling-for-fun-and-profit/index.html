It&rsquo;s not far from the truth.
I like to engage people and normally Twitter is great medium for engaging folks. Unfortunately, the message size limit makes Twitter an imperfect medium for involved discussions.</p><p>I know better but sometimes I forget.</p><p>Anyway, last friday I realized near the end of the day that I had pretty much gone off the rails. If I wasn&rsquo;t bitching about Maven and Java, I was involved in random discussions about the SaltStack project. Combine that with normal inane bullshit and I somehow managed to pull off a 60+ tweets. It took a comment by <code>roidrage</code> on IRC to point out that I really needed to calm down.</p><p>With that, I declared communication blackout for the weekend. I decided to go to happy hour and spend the weekend just having fun with the family. It was awesome. So sorry for the sheer number of people I managed to piss off on Friday.</p><h1 id=trolling-github>Trolling Github</h1><p>One of the things I also decided to do not stress about making time to hack. I knew that if I got working on one of my projects, I would totally stay distracted thinking about it.</p><p>So I went trolling. On Github.</p><p>I was just poking around Github, when I saw in my feed that some commits were done to the <a href=https://github.com/imatix/zguide>user&rsquo;s guide for ZeroMQ</a>. Because I have a serious geek woody for ZeroMQ, I got wrapped up reading the guide and looking at some of the more advanced examples. I&rsquo;ve got some ideas I want to implement in Ark and Noah that involved 0mq so I figured it would be time well spent.</p><p>Now if anyone has bothered to read the <a href=http://zguide.zeromq.org/>zguide</a>, you&rsquo;ll know that one of the BEST parts is the code samples. Seriously. They have examples for all of the architectures in almost every language. I don&rsquo;t know a single goddamn person who knows <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HaXe>Haxe</a>, but there are examples in the guide for Haxe. You can see an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about <a href=http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Divide-and-Conquer>here</a>.</p><p>Notice at the bottom the list of examples for languages. If you mouse over the last entry, many times you&rsquo;ll get multiples highlighted. This means that chunk of highlighted languages doesn&rsquo;t have any examples written.</p><p>I noticed that quite a few of the advanced ones didn&rsquo;t have Ruby versions. I started back at the beginning of the guide until I found the first one that didn&rsquo;t have a Ruby example - the <code>interrupt</code> example.</p><h1 id=challenge-accepted>Challenge Accepted</h1><p>So here I am - resolved not to work on any of my own projects and knowing that I didn&rsquo;t have time to get involved with something TOO heavy. I decided to fork the guide and start adding missing Ruby examples.</p><p>Now I only got two example done the entire weekend. This mainly revolved around how limited my time was but also around getting REALLY comfortable with <a href=https://github.com/chuckremes/ffi-rzmq>ffi-rzmq</a>. I wanted to make sure that the examples I wrote had the write mix of idiomatic Ruby and yet explicit enough for someone who didn&rsquo;t know the specifics of <code>ffi-rzmq</code>.</p><p>One that I really struggled with was this one:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/imatix/zguide/commit/4c231d1023819152813fad09a45458bd33cb02a9>https://github.com/imatix/zguide/commit/4c231d1023819152813fad09a45458bd33cb02a9</a></p><p>If you get familiar with the zguide, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of references to <code>zhelpers</code>. It&rsquo;s really just a bunch of boilerplate code that helps keep the actual examples to a nice consumable chunk size. There was not a <code>zhelpers</code> for the Ruby examples. I looked at the others to get an idea of what kinds of things were in there. In relation to the <code>identity</code> examples, there was a dump helper that just dumped the contents of a message. If you look at the <a href=https://github.com/imatix/zguide/blob/master/examples/Python/zhelpers.py>Python</a> and <a href=https://github.com/imatix/zguide/blob/master/examples/C/zhelpers.h>C</a> examples for <code>dump</code>, you&rsquo;ll see how they pull the identity of the message out. An interesting comparision, is how the <a href=https://github.com/imatix/zguide/blob/master/examples/Scala/utils.scala>Scala</a> version of <code>dump</code> works.</p><p>Instead of focusing on duplicating the strategy employed by the C and Python versions, I went with something that fit how <code>ffi-rzmq</code> works a bit more. I realized that the point was not the content of the helpers so much as the end result, showing that 0mq would generate an identity for a message if one wasn&rsquo;t explcitly provided.</p><p>I&rsquo;m quite sure that at some point, ZMQ::Message objects will get an attribute accessor to simply return the identity. Right now the code base is under a bit of a refactor.</p><h1 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h1><p>I really want to encourage others to do something like this. No pressure. Just troll Github. Look at some projects that are interesting. Look at the open issues. Fork, fix a bug or two and make some pull requests. After that, go on your merry way. No obligations. At worst, you&rsquo;ve spent some time sharpening your skills. At best, however, you&rsquo;ve made a lasting contribution.</p><p>And shit, it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a code contribution. If you can grok the project well enough, add some wiki pages.</p><p>I dunno. Github just has this amazingly easy flow for contribution. Do unto others and all that.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=https://blog.lusis.org/js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
