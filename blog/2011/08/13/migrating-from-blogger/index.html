It&rsquo;s fun and I like to feel self-important by dumping my ideas. I enjoy writing so blogging is cool like that.</p><p>Over the past 12 years I&rsquo;ve gone through various tools to help me do that (in no particular order):</p><ul><li>PHPnuke</li><li>Postnuke</li><li>Moveable Type</li><li>Plone</li><li>CakePHP</li><li>rst2html vim plugin</li><li>Blogger</li><li>Wordpress</li><li>Homegrown shit</li></ul><p>With the exception of one, all of these tools were simply a pain in the ass. They required lots of moving pieces, we&rsquo;re bug ridden and security nightmares.
The one tool I enjoyed the most?</p><p>rst2html in Vim</p><p>The only reason I used those tools was because I hated writing HTML. I hated dealing with styling. About 3 years ago I finally settled on using Blogger. Now I&rsquo;m changing again.</p><h1 id=blogger-and-markdown>Blogger and Markdown</h1><p>While I was perfectly happy with Blogger, one thing that kept annoying me was that writing posts became tedious. Working inside a textarea widget was still painful. I used Scribefire for a while in Firefox. For the last 4 months or so, I&rsquo;ve been writing my blog posts in Markdown, manually converting them to HTML with pandoc and then pasting them into blogger.</p><p>I tried the google CLI tools but I still had to massage the generated output so I never bothered to automate any of the posting part. Additionally, as much more of posts became technical, I found myself jumping over to gists and pasting the embedded content link into the posts. The whole workflow sucked.</p><h1 id=octopress-and-github>Octopress and Github</h1><p>The other day I came across <a href=https://github.com/imathis/octopress>Octopress</a>. The default style was attractive. It handled code VERY well. Best of all, I could work in Vim, run a few rake commands and my content would be published to Github.</p><p>WIN!</p><p>I find this workflow MUCH easier and sane. It&rsquo;s very coder friendly.</p><p>What&rsquo;s also nice is that, should github go away (god forbid), I have everything here self-contained to run on my own server.</p><h1 id=old-posts>Old posts</h1><p>I&rsquo;m currently in the process of redoing what blogger posts I have that weren&rsquo;t already in Markdown. I&rsquo;m converting the more &ldquo;popular&rdquo; posts first and then I&rsquo;ll get the remainder. It&rsquo;s a little painful but the light at the end of the tunnel is that I only have to do this once.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=https://blog.lusis.org/js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
