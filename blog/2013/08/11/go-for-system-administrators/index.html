If I never directly touch a Go concurrency primitive, I&rsquo;m convinced I&rsquo;m going to write all my cli apps with it just for ease of deployment.
{% endblockquote %}</p><p>This is something I said the other day. I figured it deserved a more detailed blog post.</p><h2 id=nkotb>NKOTB</h2><p>Most people who know me professionally know two things about me:</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;m fairly pragmatic and somewhat conservative about technology decisions</li><li>I&rsquo;m a language tourist</li></ul><p>This second one is something Bryan Berry attributed to me in an early FoodFight episode. What&rsquo;s interesting is the two things seemingly conflict.</p><p>I love learning new programming languages. This comes as a pretty big shock to me on a regular basis because I&rsquo;m not a professional programmer. I didn&rsquo;t go to college for programming (I actually didn&rsquo;t go to college at all). My career in IT has been pretty much 100% focused on the area of operations. Anything I&rsquo;ve ever touched - qa, dba, dev - has always been from that lens and to satisfy some need operationally.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s weird that I find myself 18 years later having a working knowledge of ruby, python, perl, java and a few other languages to a lesser degree. Mainly I come to new languages to scratch an itch.</p><p>This leads me to picking up Go.</p><p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of Go, there are countless articles, blog posts and a shitload of new tooling written in it. The latest batch of hotness around linux containers and new deployment models (docker) is based on Go. There are also quite a few other &ldquo;big&rdquo; name projects built in Go as well - packer, etcd. Mozilla is doing all new internal tooling in Go (as I understand it) and quite a few folks are switching to it.</p><p>Mind you I don&rsquo;t pick up languages based on popularity. I don&rsquo;t care for JavaScript and Node at all, for instance. Originally I had no interest in Go either. I figured it was another Google experiment that was more academic than anything else. Besides, if I had to get a handle on a c-like language, why not just learn C and be done with it?</p><p>I actually attempted that route working on a PAM module for StormPath. While it was somewhat satisfying, it was ultimately VERY frustrating.</p><h2 id=so-why-go-now>So why Go now?</h2><p>One of the reasons I decided to give Go another shot was that it appeared to be around for the long haul after all. That made at least a contender for me.
But then some of the tooling I was using operationally was being built in Go. Since I wanted to be able to fix issues in those tools (especially considering they were new projects which would surely need fixes) I really needed to pick up on the language.</p><p>However one tool really pushed me that last step - <a href=https://github.com/coreos/etcd>etcd</a>.</p><p>You can read up on etcd yourself but if you know my history with <a href=https://github.com/lusis/Noah>Noah</a>, you realize WHY I have such an interest in this.</p><p>What surprised me was when I decided that I&rsquo;d probably be writing a lot of tooling myself in Go.</p><h2 id=on-pragmatism>On Pragmatism</h2><p>All the internal tooling my team develops at Dell Enstratius is written in Python. This was a pragmatic choice for us:</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s the least common denominator on platforms our product supports (So it will always be on customer systems)</li><li>It&rsquo;s rigid in the right ways for new programmers (of which we had quite a few on our team)</li><li>Regardless of skill level with Python, you can usually look at someone else&rsquo;s code and follow it thanks to the previous item</li></ul><p>Why didn&rsquo;t we go with Ruby considering I was personally much stronger at Ruby and we had some Ruby experience via Chef internally?</p><ul><li>Have you seen the state of Ruby on distros?</li><li>We didn&rsquo;t want to conflict with any possible customer tooling using Ruby</li><li>Not enough rigidity for the new folks</li><li>As comfortable as I am at Ruby, because of the flexibility of the language and metaprogramming, it can be downright impossible to navigate someone else&rsquo;s code</li></ul><p>Our team weighed all the options here and we all agreed on Python. I set out to write a library for accessing our API. This would give us a foundation for our tooling as well as serve as a reference project - with tests, project structure, bin scripts and the like - for new tooling.</p><p>Things are/were going great up until a recent situation with a customer. We try and minimize dependencies in our tooling for obvious reasons. However there are a few libraries that just make things SO much easier - <a href=https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>requests</a>, <a href=https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy>envoy</a>. We also like to use <a href=http://fabfile.org>Fabric</a> to wrap some things up.</p><p>However we ran into a situation where a customer refused to let us pull packages in externally. So while we could &ldquo;sneakernet&rdquo; the bulk of our tools over, some things wouldn&rsquo;t work. Tracking down all the transitive deps and vendoring everything was a pain in the ass.</p><p>This is what lead to my statement above.</p><h2 id=tooling-in-go>Tooling in Go</h2><p>Go, while not as tight a feedback loop as Python, is still pretty tight. Compilations happen fast and you can test fairly quickly. But the dependency issue is really the killer. It simply doesn&rsquo;t exist. I can take that binary I compiled and move it around with no problem without needing the runtime installed. There are lots of batteries included in the stdlib as well.</p><p>I can also compile that same code on osx, windows or linux with no modification. This bit us in Python with some of our deps as well.</p><p>As I said, while the tooling I&rsquo;m currently writing has no need for any of the advanced concurrency stuff in go, it&rsquo;s nice that&rsquo;s it there out of the box should I want to use it.</p><h2 id=this-isnt-a-switching-story>This isn&rsquo;t a switching story</h2><p>We&rsquo;re not switching to Go for our tooling but I probably will. I&rsquo;m already working on writing a wrapper for our API in Go so I can duplicate some of the tools. This will be really handy when I&rsquo;m on a system where dependencies are limited. That&rsquo;s really what this post is about.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re in operations, there is no reason you shouldn&rsquo;t learn Go.</p><p>The syntax is easy. The stuff that made C painful is largely hidden from you. Meanwhile you don&rsquo;t need to worry about what version of Python or Ruby is installed on your systems. It&rsquo;s a great language to use for bootstrap tools where you don&rsquo;t yet have your deps installed. It&rsquo;ll also help should you start adopting tools like docker, packer or etcd.</p><p>Give it a shot.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=https://blog.lusis.org/js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
