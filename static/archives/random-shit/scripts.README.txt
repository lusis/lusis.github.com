A note about my scripts:
Scripts in the nagios directory have been fairly well tested. 
I try to account for possible error and "fat fingers" that we all make.

Feel free to let me know of any updates to these scripts that you think they need.

The scripts in the usable directory are usable in our specific environment. 
I just remember the hell I went though trying to find scripts for specific things. 
I figure if I can save someone time with a starting point then I will.

I make no guarantee that any of these scripts won't screw up your environment. 
Always test these against pre-prod or dev servers first!
I make no statement as to the asthetics of these scripts...especially the ones in the usable directory.
