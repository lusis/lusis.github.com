So my work phone doesn't have a camera built in. Couldn't snap a picture but I saw a sign in downtown Roswell today at lunch that really pissed me off.<br /><br />"Be patriotic. Stimulate the economy"<br /><br />This was on the front of one of the local shops. My first reaction, which I dutifully followed through with, was to call my wife and bitch and moan.<br /><br />I dread the day when my spending becomes the measure of my patriotism.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-1239201175243267677?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
