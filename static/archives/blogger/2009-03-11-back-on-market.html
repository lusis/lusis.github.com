Well MediaOcean/DDS had to do a round of layoffs. Unfortunately for me, I was one of the most recent hires so I was on the block ;)<br /><br />It was all very tastefully done and I have a months of severance pay to hold me over. I've already gotten a few leads on new positions so I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnHaTlI1p7o">"got that going for me"</a>.<br /><br />The upshot is that I now have some time to get back into working on some tips and such for Nagios. I'm also working on some POC stuff using Amazon AWS. I'll have information on those shortly.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-1180592894228085047?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
