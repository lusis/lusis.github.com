Anyone have anymore information?<br /><br />Listening to the Code Monkey mp3 is pretty incriminating. I fancy myself a google ninja and I could find nothing about this site or the guy mentioned. I'm going to start searching for some of his songs next.<br /><br />EDIT: So Erine Wade is/was from Moosup, CT according to the link. Coulton hails from Colchester, CT. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moosup">Moosup is a village in Plainfield, CT.</a><br /><br />Here's a mapping courtesy of Google:<br /><a href="http://is.gd/pRf0">http://is.gd/pRf0</a><br /><br />35 miles. Don't know CT that well so I'm not sure how often someone would make that drive.<br /><br />This Ernie Wade guy was 7 years older than Coulton.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole thing could be a hoax. I c.b.a do to any more research than that and I don't have anymore source material since the original link was a tweet.<br /><br />EDIT2: Site exceeded bandwidth so no way to verify email link. Agreeing with @danco that it's a hoax. *puts tinfoil hat back on the shelf*<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-298695531596616198?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
