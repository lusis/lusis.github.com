A few (okay 2) years ago I wrote a small page on my website <a href="http://dev.lusis.org/nagios/usable/websphere-perl-rrd.html">documenting how to get container statistics out of Websphere 5.x from the command-line</a>. To this day, awstats shows that, and the page on <a href="http://dev.lusis.org/nagios/usable/monitoring_db_with_nagios.html">monitoring DB2 UDB with Nagios</a> as the single biggest hit pages. I like to occasionally take note of where people are coming from to look at the information.<br /><br />In looking at the logs this morning, I see the standard incoming search result from google for something like "websphere + jdbc + command-line" or "websphere + jdbc + monitoring" but what caught my eye was something in the USERAGENT string:<br /><br />"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080211 Fedora/2.0.0.12-1.oc2 <span style="font-weight: bold;">(CK-IBM) (CK-IBM)</span> Firefox/2.0.0.12"<br /><br />Was someone from IBM looking at *MY* notes?  Why, yes, they were:<br /><br />torolab.ibm.com<br /><br />Thanks for visiting guys. I'm even more honored that it was someone from Toronto.<br /><br />EDIT: I just noticed the CK part of the IBM thing. I finally remembered why that looked familiar. Does IBM have an internal client customization kit for Firefox? For those not in the know, here's a link to the mozilla wiki entry on the concept/program:<br /><br /><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/CCK:Overview">http://wiki.mozilla.org/CCK:Overview</a><br /><br />Basically it was the repackager for Netscape that allowed ISP branding, locked settings and a host of other features.  I wasn't aware that there was one for Firefox but I haven't really needed one since I left CLA.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-3876391667723516616?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
