This basically involves the me swinging his fists at my face and making old kung-fu movie sounds. Occasionally, I'll make him punch my stomach and say "Body Blow!" in that iconic Punch-out voice.<br /><br />He giggles like a loon. And yes I have video footage ;)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-8409983640723381592?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
