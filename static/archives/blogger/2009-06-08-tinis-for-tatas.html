I wanted to remind everyone who might possibly read this and lives in Atlanta that Crepe Revolution is hosting Tinis for Tatas tomorrow night:<br /><br />http://creperevolution.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/tinis-for-tatas/<br /><br />This is a pretty big deal as one of our dinner club friends is a survivor as well as one of my guild mates in World of Warcraft. If you're in the Atlanta area, please try and come.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-1359344668637695029?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
