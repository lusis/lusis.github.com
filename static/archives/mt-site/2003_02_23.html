<p>Well it's official.</p>


<p>Michelle and I got engaged Thursday night. I was crafty and smooth and it payed off.</p>

<p>Actually I was a nervous wreck. </p>

<p>I had the ring for 3 weeks prior. I WANTED to give it to her the night we found out we were pre-approved for our homeloan but I hadn't spoken with her parents at the time. They came down over Valentine's Day weekend along with her brother and his fiancee. We went to the RedWings game and the outlets and what not.</p>

<p>But back to the ring! (My precious as Michelle calls it. Scary!)</p>

<p>I had been planning on going out on a date this week. Friday and the rest of the weekend was out because she had a class all day each day. That left Thursday (farthest day out). We got dressed to go out to eat but we stopped across the street at Vickery Creek to take a walk. There's a nice set of cliffs there that alot of folks like to climb down. I took a couple of pictures of the cliff (knowing full well she would want a memory of it as would I).</p>

<p>Then I got her over by the cliffs to take a picture. She wanted to take one of me too. So I went over to the edge and waited. I put my hands in my pocket and felt the box. Something came over me and I pulled it out and opened it while she had the viewfinder up. She let the camera down and asked me what that was as I walked closer to her with the box open. I asked. She said yes.</p>

<p>After we got calmed down and sat down on the rocks, she said "Are you for real?". Heh.</p>

<p>Anyways, I've uploaded some pictures to the gallery. You can get to them <a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/album23">here</a>. YAH!</p>
