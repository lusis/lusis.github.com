<span class="title">Recent downtime</span>

<p>Well you might have noticed that the site was down for a while over the holiday weekend. Let me explain what happened as much as possible.</p>


<p>I got a call from my boss Friday afternoon around 2:30. It seems he couldn't get to our marketing website. I checked some things from the house and sure enough we were down hard. </p>

<p>My next step is to call the office and see if it was just the internet circuit or all three t's.</p>

<p>Fast busy.</p>

<p>I started fearing the worst. We have issues with power in our area. It's not uncommon for us to have brownouts in the middle of the day. I figured we had an extended power outage and the UPS's died. </p>

<p>Since I have 45 minute drive to the office, I kept trying to call every so often. I also was wondering if the alarms were out if the power had been off this long. Still busy.</p>

<p>I get to the office and see we have power. I pick up handset and try to dial out. No free lines.</p>

<p>I headed into the phone room and see that all three smart jacks are dead. No lights. Nothing.</p>

<p>I call Qwest and MCI and figure whoever gets to bellsouth the fastest will be my hero. </p>

<p>After playing about all of the cribbage I could play whilst working with our providers, I decide to grab a laptop and hook it up to a POTS line to browse the web.</p>

<p>No dial tone?</p>

<p>I then check the fax machines and realize that I can't get anything. Time to call Bellsouth business services directly on those lines. Turns out they have ""a cable problem"".</p>

<p>I call back our providers and explain to them what info I got from Bellsouth. I tell them I'm going home and I'll wait for Bellsouth to contact me.</p>

<p>That's when it gets good.</p>

<p>As I'm leaving the office, I see 3 bellsouth trucks down by the box. I'm an amicable guy so I wanted to go apologize for having them rush out when I didn't realize it was a larger problem. As I walk up and shout hello, I notice three of the saddest and most pissed off guys on the planet. I explain who I am and then they decide to show me the  phone box.</p>

<p>It's in tatters. Wires are everywhere. I can't say much other than that on the issue because there's an active police involvement but this was some nasty stuff. Let's leave it with this. There were 1200 pairs in that box. Not one was left.</p>

<p>So as you can see, this wasn't something lame like hardware failure whilst I was out of town. It was much more serious and I apologise to everyone involved.</p>
