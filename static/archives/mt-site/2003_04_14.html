<p>In the tradition of providing you with entertaining spam, here is the latest bit of poorly planned email.</p>


<pre>
Hi my name is David DeLanoy from 180Solutions Inc. I am contacting you because 180solutions would like
to bundle
n-CASE, our comparison-alternative shopping engine with your products, such as, Ari's Yahoo Client
1.10.
In return I will work with you to create a revenue package that will increase your monthly revenue.
If you are interested, please give me a call at 425-576-4239 or email me at ddelanoy@180solutions.com.

<p>In regards to distribution, typically the distributors bundle n-CASE in their existing setup programs<br />
or as a part of an upgrade,<br />
and then give their users the option to install n-CASE during setup. Currently over 60% of users opt to<br />
install n-CASE. In<br />
agreement, 180Solutions payes $.07 for every user who opts into installing n-CASE.</p>

<p>What is n-CASE? n-CASE is a Comparative Alternative Shopping Engine that 180Solutions has created to<br />
provide the user with more<br />
direct results in their search process. It is the most widely distributed application of its kind with<br />
over 16 million users worldwide.</p>

<p><br />
If you are interested in even more detailed information about us, please visit our site at:<br />
http://www.180solutions.com/?ref=dtd08</p>

<p><br />
If you are interested in working with us to provide your users with valuable software, as well as help<br />
generate revenue for<br />
your company  please contact me directly so that we can discuss working together. I look forward to<br />
hearing from you.</p>

<p>Respectfully,<br />
David DeLanoy<br />
ddelanoy@180Solutions.com<br />
425-576-4239<br />
</pre></p>

<p>Now showing that spammers and spyware creators are cut from the same cloth, David wants to do business with me!</p>

<p>A few points for David DeLanoy:</p>

<p>1) I'm just the technical contact for the domain where Ari's site is hosted. If you weren't just spamming whois records, you might know that.</p>

<p>2) Ari's Yahoo Client is a linux based product. Have you been so kind as to port your spyware to linux? Also, since Ari's Yahoo Client is under the GPL, you are aware that integrating your code would require that it be distributed under the selfsame license? I guess Ari, as original license grantor, could create a dual-license but it WOULD be interesting to get the source for some of this spyware to disable it.</p>

<p>3) This is a CONSOLE based program. What exactly are you spying on from the console? "My god Jim, this guy is running a screen session and an ssh session, let's send him an ad for tampons!"</p>

<p>Silly idiots. Don't bother the nice people.</p>
