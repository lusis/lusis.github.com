<span class="title">Wow...again I say wow</span>

<p>I just bought the "Queen of the Damned" soundtrack and it kicks some SERIOUS ass.</p>


<p>"I've been a fan of Korn (and specifically Jon Davis) for several years now. I used to think that Korn was nothing but a white-trash metal band. I enjoyed hearing a few songs from ""Life Is Peachy"" on the radio but nothing that stuck with me.</p>

<p>Then one day my ex-roomate, ninja, played ""Daddy"" for me. I've been a fan ever since. That song made me realize the depth that Jon Davis could sing with and his talent as a musician. Korn never ceases to amaze me with each album.</p>

<p>When I heard that Jon Davis wrote some of the songs for ""Queen of the Damned"", I knew I had to have the soundtrack.</p>

<p>I haven't seen the movie yet. But at least I can listen to the music.</p>

<p>I knew that due to some contact bullshit, Jon Davis couldn't sing on the soundtrack but that he called in a few favors for vocals.( or at least the label did )</p>

<p>Wayne Static (of Static-X)<br />
David Draiman (of Disturbed)<br />
Chester Bennington (of Linkin Park)<br />
Marylin Manson (of weirdo fame ;>)<br />
Jay Gordon (of Orgy)</p>

<p>Tell me that's not a killer lineup? </p>

<p>The album also has various other songs already out an about from other band's albums like the Deftones (Change), Papa Roach (who cares? allthough I did see the lead singer guy at the Atlanta Airport the last time Michelle came down), Static-X and even Tricky (this man is a god).</p>

<p><br />
A few other interesting notes about the album:</p>

<p>Head and Munkey  played guitars on all almost all the songs that Davis wrote.</p>

<p>Richard Gibbs (of Oingo Boingo and several other projects) teamed up with Davis and a full orchestra to do the score. </p>

<p>When I read the name Richard Gibbs, I wasn't initally sure who he was. After all, the only person people remember from Oingo Boingo is Danny Elfman ;)</p>

<p>I hit AMG and looked him up. The first set of results listed a TON of gospel albums. I clicked for more information and verified that it was the same guy. Wacky. It seems this guy gets around more than a drunk sorority girl at U.G.A.</p>

<p>All in all I seriously suggest you get this cd. It's actually the first cd I've bought in several years without having first downloaded it from the internet to decide if I like it.</p>

<p>Here are some links about the cd:</p>
