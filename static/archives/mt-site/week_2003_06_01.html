<span class="title">Joe Job on my server</span>

<p>Well it looks like I've been <a href="http://www.techtv.com/news/culture/story/0,24195,3415219,00.html" title="techtv.com">Joe Job'd.</a></p>


<p>Looks like someone snagged an email address from google groups and they're using it to send out a few viruses. It's also possible that the sender is someone who was already infected. Alot of newer viruses are using I.E. cache files to grab email addresses. I searched the groups myself and didn't find any reference to this email address posted by pine. This also leads to another caution. Pine likes to insert some random information in the headers for internal use.</p>

<p>There are patches for pine to fix this but for now I'm telling my mailserver to block ANYTHING that is addressed to PINE*@* with a message about the Joe Job.</p>

<p>Here's the original reject I got from w3.org. Notice that the destination address was random as well:</p>

<p>Okay so a few people know I like to play a game called <a href="http://www.uo.com" title="UO">Ultima Online</a>. Well I'm not going to go into too many details but check out the above link. If you play the game, you'll understand how funny it is (And you've probably read it already). If you play some other game, you'll still understand. If you don't play any game, just laugh at North Korea!</p>

<p><a title="Weapons of mass destruction were never the real issue" href="http://www.ajc.com/print/content/epaper/editions/wednesday/opinion_e3ddf850e14eb1df00f6.html">Welcome to AJC!</a></p>


<p>Let me say this. Recently I've been feeling like I bought into some sort of lie. </p>

<p>I was the first to admit that I never felt threatened by Iraq. My thought was that I trusted Colin Powell more than the UN.</p>

<p>After all is said and done, I pick up a <a href="http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/index.html" title="website not really up to date">periodical</a> a few weeks ago at Barnes and Noble while getting a few study guides for the CCNA.</p>

<p>In this magazine, there was an article that disected the GWB speech before we went to war (the 48 hours speech). After various parts, the writer would add his commentary. He made some interesting points. Much of it centered around the LP policy of foriegn involvement. His point was that while Saddam was an asshole (my words) and deserved whatever came to him, the information regarding WOMDs was inaccurate and that even if it were valid, Iraq is a soveriegn state and that we had no right to attack them.</p>

<p>Let me make a few points. </p>

<p>I don't care how many people think that the 9-11 attackers came from Iraq. That proves nothing except the stupidity of the uneducated populace.</p>

<p>I don't care that some people are calling the war illegal. My interpretation is that the original UN resolution gave any member of the security council the right to enforce disarmament. I don't like the UN one bit but they did make the rule.</p>

<p>Things in the world are alot closer now.  Someone over in the middle east can pose a threat to our national security and not be on our shores. 9-11 itself proved that the definition of a threat has grown. </p>

<p>Either way, while Friedman (a writer who I love reading and usually agree with) says that he would have accepted that we had to attack Iraq for stability in the Middle East, I don't think I would have. I just wish I hadn't bought into the bull. I'm too smart for that.</p>

<p>I found this site from <a href="http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com/" title="EXCELLENT site">HYCW</a>, a site I check in on for design tips and commentary.</p>

<p>I've never actually bothered with photoblogs and never really considered them but the hunkabutta site (which seems to me to be a nice play on engrish) is just excellent.</p>

<p>The photos are brilliant .  Read and enjoy.</p>

<p>Actually I think it's been out for a while. I've been so busy that I didn't even know. 'Lucky You' is on the matrix reloaded soundtrack and that's what prompted me to hit deftones.com and see what was up.</p>

<p>I plan on buying the album here soon even if the some of the reviews are brutal. I've been warned not to expect "Adrenaline" or "Around The Fur" style material.</p>

<p>On another note, hit the videos section of deftones.com and watch the video for 'Minerva' and then watch 'Digital Bath'. I actually noticed this but it had been a while since I had seen Deftones live (hence watching the video for 'Digital Bath'), but has Chino gained some weight? I guess a few years off the road will do that. Not that it matters to me. Everyone knows I'm a big guy ;)</p>

<p>I just figured he got tired of looking like <a href="http://pics.heyoh.com/nye2k2/01080036.JPG" title="threedays">Ben Layer</a> with the ski goggles in the D.B. video.</p>
