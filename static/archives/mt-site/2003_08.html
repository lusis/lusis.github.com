<p>It seems I forgot to change the mailserver setting when I copied my mt stuff over to the new server. </p>


<p>I've actually gotten comments and didn't even know it. Of course I've so busy on this webapp I've been creating that I haven't had time to do much else. That's fixed now. If you leave comments, I'll know and read them.</p>

<p>Michelle has been very supportive. I'm still with the company that was supposed to be closing up in June.  I knew I wouldn't be around after things finished so I've been happy to have any extra days (months even!). I really feel for the people who are going to be around afterwards  because of all the indetermination.</p>

<p>I also interviewed with a company that decided not to hire me because they though I was a windows guy. I'm still trying to figure out who they interviewed because it wasn't me.</p>

<p>FYI: new pictures:<br />
<a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/J-n-J-Wedding/" title="Jon and Jaime's wedding pictures">The Wedding (not mine!)</a></p>

<p>This is Michelle's brother and his new wife. The wedding was awesome and I got to takes notes (or was ordered to take notes =P). Since Michelle and I are getting married on the beach, some things didn't translate so well though. I was also a lector as well. </p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, you can see a picture of me and Michelle from  right before while we were getting ready.</p>

<p><a href="http://lusis.org/gallery/J-n-J-Wedding/aan" title="aww cute!">Michelle and I</a>. Get this, she caught the bouquet. I just sat there and said "She's the next to get married? No crap!"</p>

<p>Anyways, that's the status update. I'm going to go back to working on my small business software and drown myself in php.</p>

<span class="title">John's Ad Block</span>

<p><a title="John's Ad Blocker" href="http://www.lusis.org/static/johnsadblock.xpi">Mozilla/Netscape7/Firebird adblocker</a> (right-click and save to desktop. Then open with Mozilla)</p>


<p>So I was playing around with <a href="http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/" title="Flash click-to-view">this package</a> because pulling the xml file over the internet was really dragging down flash pages. After installing I realized that it 1) overwrote my userContent.css and 2) wouldn't install to my user profile directory.</p>

<p>After googling a bit, I found out that 1) xpi files are just zip files and 2) making an app install in the user profile directory is as easy as changing 2 lines in the install.js.</p>

<p>That led me to package my userContent.css with Ted's click to view changes. The result is my nifty adblocker along with the flash click to view installed locally in the user profile directory.</p>

<p>The upshot is that I can easy install the app without having to navigate to the profile directory and all that.</p>

<p>Let me know if you use it. I might decide to play around with some mozilla plugins a bit more.</p>

<p>Edit: If anyone has any ideas as to why apache wants to serve this file as text, I'd appreciate it. I've added "AddType application/x-xpinstall .xpi" to my .htaccess but its not making any difference. Seems to only be happening on windows.</p>
