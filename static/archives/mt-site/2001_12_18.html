<span class="title">My brain hurts......</span>

<p>and I'm going home.</p>


<p>Don't you just HATE those days when you think too much? I sure as hell do.</p>

<p>I walked into the door today and found out our VPN to one of our clients was down. In the process of walking into the server room to check the switch (a cheap ass linksys - nothing fancy for this particular setup was needed), I get sidetracked with another customer project. Seems our load tests keep failing and it might be a config issue on one of the 2000 servers (customer provided license so kiss my ass Microsoft). </p>

<p>In the process of getting THAT fixed, my boss mentions that So-and-So working on Project A (the one that hit me as I came in the door) was having problems. I inform said boss that I was working on that when I got sidetracked by Project B. I was informed that Project A is more important than Project B at this particular moment. I then procede to debug Project A until it's running again. </p>

<p>Turns out a port on the switch went bad for Project A. Turns out some Active Directory shit was fubar'd on Project B.</p>

<p>I sit down at my desk and it's already 12:00. </p>

<p>I decided to take the rest of the day to research some system admin stuff that I've been putting off. Software audit tools and the like. I spent the rest of the day reading Technet until just now when I patched our Office 2000 Standard SR-1 install with all the new patches.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to change out backup tapes and i'm going the hell home. If you're reading this from YOUR desk, I suggest you do the same.</p>

<p>At least I got all my christmas shopping done.</p>
