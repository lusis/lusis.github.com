<p>I like this!</p>


<p>I started futzing around with some various stylesheets. I really wanted to avoid tables as well.</p>

<p>I finally came across <a href="http://blogstyles.com/">BlogStyles</a>.</p>

<p>They had a three column layout that I liked alot. Since they were free for all, I took it and modified a few colors. I hope it's readable and loads nicely. My understanding and personal experience is that the only browser it DOESN'T load properly on is IE4.5 on Mac. </p>

<p>Anyone with a Mac has probably upgraded browsers by now anyway. Especially with Safari hanging around. I'll verify that it works okay when rendered with KHTML (which Safari uses) when I get home tonight.</p>

<p>It's all based in css so any browser that behaves should be able to read it.</p>

<p>Bother me if it doesn't work for you. I'd like to test it out myself</p>

<p>The gallery has been upgraded and templated in with the rest of the site.<br />
You can get to it from the link on the left or from <a href="http://www.lusis.org/gallery">here</a></p>
