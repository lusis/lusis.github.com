<span class="title">checks and balances: Bush Administration reminder</span>

<p>Jose Padilla gets to see his lawyers!</p>


<p>Now before I go any further, let me say that i think the guy is scum. I think he is useless and that I hope he gets the full force of the law brought against him.</p>

<p>Some of you may not remember. I'm guessing the Bush Administration and the Ashcroft Regime was happy if that's the case.</p>

<p>An American citizen was being held illegally by the military. He was denied Due Process and all his rights were stripped.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that. </p>

<p>And American citizen. Just like you and just like me. Not someone in the States on a Visa. Nothing at all like that. Mind you he's a criminal with a gang record, but he is still a citizen and by the U.S. Constitution, entitled to certain rights as such.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was detained by the government for having SUSPECTED ties to Al Qaeda. They said he MIGHT have been involved in a plot to detonate a dirty bomb.</p>

<p>Let's cut through all the emotional rhetoric and get down to what this really is.</p>

<p>Despite his ties, if any, to Al Qaeda, this was a citizen of this country who was arrested for his thoughts.</p>

<p>Thoughtcrime.</p>

<p>The government claimed he was an "enemy combatant" and therefore his rights were out the window. </p>

<p>Jose Padilla didn't rise up and take arms against the U.S. He was arrested on a material witness warrant and secretly held in a government prison.</p>

<p>This vague "enemy combatant" crap has to go. He didn't DO anything. The government had to nothing but label him and he looses all his rights? I don't remember reading that part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>As bad as some people think it sounds, there are different rules for citizens and non-citizens. If you want the protection of the Constitution of the United States, only one thing is asked in return. That is to be a citizen of the United States. It says "We the people of the Untied States of America"  not "We the people of the world". If you are a citizen of this country, our government's job is to ensure the rights set forth in that document.</p>

<p>Jose Padilla was granted that right by birth. Whether or not he deserves it is not up for the government to decide. I'm still researching but as far as I understand, the only way you can revoke your birth-right citizenship in the U.S., other than filing for it, is to physically go to war for a foreign government against the U.S. Most of the stuff I've found online involves denaturalizing immigrants.</p>

<p>Let me remind everyone yet again, I don't support this Padilla character IF he was indeed planning (not actually doing) these things but if I want my birthrights to stay secure, I have to stand up for his.</p>

<p>Let the government play fair ball the way they've had to for 200 years and convict him in a U.S. court.</p>

<span class="title">Screenshot - Antialiased and all</span>

<p>I'm just so proud that all the compiling finished that I had to take a screenshot.</p>


<p>Here's the lowdown. I got tired of my current look. I really wanted AA fonts in Mozilla. After a few false starts, I basically recompiled EVERYTHING from source off the redhat 8 SRPM cd's. There were a few hiccups along the way but when I was finished, I had a nice new install of Gnome2 complete with AA fonts all over the place. </p>

<p>I'm using 1.2b since Moz recalled on 1.2final. As soon as it's out again, I'll build it.</p>

<p>The fonts on my desktop are all fancy because I wanted them to be. The title bar fonts are a little LESS fancy. The actual application font is good old arial.</p>

<p>I recompiled my kernel with the latest ck patches (ck-15) and enabled low-latency and preempt. I built EVERYTHING with "-O3 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer". I figured those were nice safe flags. Since I'm still using gcc-2.96 I can't take advantage of the other fancy stuff that gcc3 has to offer. </p>

<p>The only thing I left as normal was xterm. I'm using a nice solid vga font. I can't deal with AA in a term window. It just doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips about dual running gcc296 and gcc3 on RH7.3 I'd be glad to hear it. The only reason I can't move to RH8.0 fully is a naughty bug in Kapital, which I use to manage my finances. As soon as The Kompany gets that fixed, I'm good to go though. Yes, I even tried recompiling Kapital but the bug is still there. Methinks it's a bug with QT/KDE that RedHat uses on 8.0.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here are the links to everything I used and did. Oh yeah and that handy screenshot! Any questions, shoot me an email - articles at lusis dot org</p>

<p>Random Notes:<br />
- I have two checking accounts, a savings account and a credit card account and all 4 work flawlessly in Mozilla. Rock on!<br />
- I put both filetypes on the screenshots. Are there any browsers in use that DON'T support PNG properly?<br />
- The focus is all wack in the screenshots because the gnome screenshot application takes all focus when in use. Thus no active title bars in the shot<br />
- The themes I use for Metacity and Gtk2 are LighthouseBlue. It was created by Jar in response to comments from Eugenia Loli-Queru at OSNews.com on her review of RedHat 8.0<br />
- I can build RH7.3 compliant SRPMS of everything if anyone is interested.<br />
- The song I was listening to on xmms was "Twist" by Korn. Yes I own "Life is Peachy" so bite me RIAA.<br />
- Total build time without stupid hiccups on my part ( changing build archs hardcoded into various SRPMS) was around 3 days. Let's just say I didn't use my machine much and spent alot of time on the laptop ;) It was worth it though.</p>

<span class="title">K5 spam</span>

<p>I get alot of spam. I mean alot. But sometimes I get a spam that makes me wonder WHAT in the hell someone was thinking?</p>


<p>This came to me via K5. When I say via K5, i mean some stupid bot scoured kuro5hin and snagged my email address.</p>

<p>This is why I have my own domain. I can use a different email for whatever the occasion.</p>

<p>Today's occasion is leeches. Or at least that's what some kind soul in Russia wants me to read about:</p>

<p>I've taken a bit of care with the people cc'd on this email. I masked all but the funny addresses. What I mean by funny is email addresses that were created SPECIFICALLY to avoid spam. I'm guessing it did the job because the attempted to mail the false addresses anyway.</p>

<p>I will give poor Valery credit, it's the most targetted bit of junk mail I've ever gotten. I VAGUELY remember participating in such a discussion on K5 at some point allthough my endless searching has turned up no such details.</p>

<span class="title">Commentary on Islam</span>

<p>Michelle and I were talking about this the other day.</p>


<p><a href="http://blogsofwar.blogspot.com/2002_11_24_blogsofwar_archive.html#85298621">A Religion of Peace vs. a "Religion of Peace"</a>.</p>

<p>I'm of the unresearched opinion that in general, Islam may hav inherent issues that don't allow for the peaceful coexistance of other religions. Notice I said "unresearched". I don't have the time to research with the holidays and work. Be assured that I will.</p>

<p>And yes i'm aware that the caliphats of olde did allow for christians and jews to live in Islam controlled territories. The exception was that they had to pay taxes and Muslims didn't. </p>

<p>I found the above line from <a href="http://nataliesolent.blogspot.com/">Natalie Solent's weblog</a>.</p>
