<p>I won't ever buy another linksys product.</p>


<p>It's pretty simple really. I'm tired of dealing with the Linksys idea of changing something as essential as the chipset without changing the model number.</p>

<p>This came up at work as we are working to migrate our workstations to Linux.</p>

<p>Our current install base of well over 600 Windows PCs with Linksys WMP11 cards is useless under Linux. You see Linksys has decided in thier wisdom to continually change the chipset used in these cards and not let anyone know (not even on the box) that the cards aren't the same. </p>

<p>The older models of WMP11 (version 1 and 2) work fine under Linux. The newer cards (version 3) do not. </p>

<p>At this point we told our Linksys rep we were dropping them in favor of D-Link. The USB wireless keyfobs work under Linux, are cheaper to replace (no hardware tech needed on site) and D-Link has assured me that since this is the only product line they have that works under Mac OSX, they plan on keeping it. I made my distaste with Linksys VERY clear to our new D-Link rep.</p>

<p>But the Linksys problem isn't simply applicable to the wireless card product line. It also leaks over into the WAP line as well. Currently at each of these locations we have a Linksys WAP11 access point. The model we have seems to have a nasty bug whereby you MUST input the Netmask and the gateway in the IP configuration screen in reverse order (i.e. the Netmask goes in the gateway section and vice-versa)!</p>

<p>This is insane. So I check the Linksys website for updated firmware that would surely resolve this minor but seemlingly easy flaw to fix. Check this page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linksys.com/download/">http://www.linksys.com/download/</a></p>

<p>They have 4 different versions of this damn access point with the same name!</p>

<p>How am I supposed to know which of the 4 I have when I have over 300 of these guys out there? It seems the only way is to compare the firmware version on the AP with the firmware on each model. IF the numbers are close enough you can bet that you found the right one.</p>

<p>So I go through this and find out that Linksys hasn't updated the firmware for the AP we have since August of last year! I'm guessing they don't want to bother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I'm taking my business from Linksys to D-Link (and Netgear if need be) to avoid this kind of shoddy business. I expect more from Cisco. Then again I'm slowly replacing all my cisco switches with HP5308XL and 2924 models.</p>
