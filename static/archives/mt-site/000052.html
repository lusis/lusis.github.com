<p>Well it looks like the Afghanis are determined to kill themselves.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>And I say, let 'em. Today a bomb blew up in a taxi in Kabul and later someone tried to assasinate Hamid Karzai.</p>

<p>I've now decided that the U.S. should just pull out all together. We (the U.S. Military) are providing bodyguards to Karzai. We're putting our armed forces on the line when the Middle East is bound and determined to destroy itself. <br />
Fine! If you backwards ass bastards want to kill each other, just do it.  Destroy every single bit of culture and history you have just to hold to some stupid, dated, vague and misguided  religious tenants. I don't care. While you're at it, take Benny Hinn, Jerry Fallwell and the Catholic priesthood with you.</p>

<p>Jim told me about a bumper sticker he saw the other day. It said "Lord, protect me from your followers."</p>

<p>When I was heavily involved with the church and youth ministries, one thing I always tought was that religion is a sham. Ideology and tradition and icons and the like are all a sham.* They don't get you anything.</p>

<p>Jesus said a bunch of things but one concept he always pointed out was that your relationship with God was a personal matter. You don't have to go to church. You don't have to pray in public for everyone to see.* You don't have to do ANY of that crap. The physical church building means nothing. </p>

<p>He even warned against these types of people.*</p>

<p>I know that most people cringe at the sight of anything religious. Michelle will get the joke "They said God. Quick! Change it!". I don't practice anything anymore. I don't want to explain why and I don't want you to try and explain why I should. Even so, I will pray tonight "Lord, protect me from your followers."<br />

** all of the passages below can be researched on <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net">Gospelcom</a> if you don't have a Bible handy. I would suggest you use the NIV translation. It takes the nappy King James and puts it into more modern language. You won't see Jesus telling the parable of the motorcycle but you might actually be able to understand the point being made instead of getting wrapped up in the "Yea verily thou art" language. When I was teaching, I always used an NIV version.</i><br />
