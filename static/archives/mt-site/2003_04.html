<p>Well I've found a <a href="http://www.johncompanies.com/" title="go team!">solution</a></p>


<p>I remembered seeing a link to these guys on <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org" title="there is no k5 cabal">k5</a> and decided to go back and do some research. I signed up an account this morning. It's going to cost me but two of the sites I host have agreed to split the bill with me (based on usage). I figure I'll be okay. It's just one of the costs of doing business as it were.</p>

<p>Well it seems like my site might just be shutting down soon.</p>


<p>It seems that my company will probably be shutting down in a week or so. This means I'll have to move hosting offsite somewhere inexpensive. Some people might say that I should not factor in hosting but I need a reliable email address and a place to host my resume as well as some other things (projects I'm working on that can relate to my resume). </p>

<p>Having said that, I don't know when the line will go dead but I'm working on part of that tonight (in addition to trolling monster.com!)</p>

<p>If I'm hosting a website for you, I can make a nice backup of everything you have and burn it to a cd (assuming you don't have everything backed up on your own side!).</p>

<p>And also, here's the tagline. If you know of any good companies in Atlanta or even Michigan and points in between looking for a high quality systems and network administrator, I'm available. I'll put my resume up shortly after I've updated it. I've been with this company for five years now and seeing as we did QA work, I got to play with ALOT of cool stuff. I've developed alot of neat stuff internally and handled an entire infrastucture move from one location to another by myself (and at one point sleeping under my yet-as-unfinished cubicle waiting on Qwest so things would be running by the time people came in).</p>

<p>I put alot into any company I work for and only expect that the company honors that work and respects me for it.</p>

<p>I'll keep the world updated! Or at least the world that reads my website ;)</p>

<p><a title="Poor Republicans" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/21/santorum.gays.ap/index.html">CNN.com - Gay groups criticize Santorum remarks as insensitive - Apr. 21, 2003</a></p>

<p><br />
</p>


<p>Quoth Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p><i>"If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual (gay) sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything"</i></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><i>"All of those things are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family," Santorum said. "And that's sort of where we are in today's world, unfortunately. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn't exist, in my opinion, in the United States Constitution."</i></p>

<p>Everyone cheer the GOP!  This man is a verified loon (according to someone close to me.).</p>

<p>Let's take apart some of this:</p>

<p>Polygamy - a moral issue. Nothing more. There is no scientific reason or legal reason I can think of that I man or woman shouldn't be allowed to have any type of relationship he wishes. </p>

<p>Bigamy - the legal term of polygamy. A plurality of spouses and nothing more. Same as argument for polygamy.</p>

<p>Incest - There is a scientific basis for the laws against this. Besides that, incest issues usually arise from parents raping children against the will of the child. A whole other legal issue there.</p>

<p>Adultery - While it's ground for legal divorce, it's still a moral issue if anything. </p>

<p>The fact that he would relate the behaviour of two CONSENTING adults to engage in behaviour CONSENTED to by the aforementioned CONSENTING adults is just silly.</p>

<p>Of course we get to the meat of the matter in a later statement. These behaviours are antiethical to a stable, healthy, traditional family! OF COURSE!</p>

<p>Traditions change folks. Do we still give goats as dowry? I hope not! When Michelle and I were at the Dogwood Festival, we took a break to eat lunch. As we were sitting there, I noticed a gay couple on the blanket across from us. In Atlanta, this is no big deal. What was interesting is that these two gay men, a couple, were taking care of a baby. They took turns feeding and rocking and burping and doing all the things that parents would do. I pointed it out and we remarked on it for a while. Sure we saw straight couples behaving the same way but none of them exhibited the overt love and joy that these two men did over that child. There are bad eggs in every family but I'm guessing that child gets more love than a child in most straight families.</p>

<p>I say to you again, "The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."</p>

<p>You may feel that God is going to strike down the United States because of the behaviour of its immorality but I will tell you that a government that avoids legislating the personal morality of one man over another is the only one in which you would be allowed to have that belief.</p>

<p>And as to his comment about a false sense of privacy, it is true that it is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution but, to take a quote from the ACLU:</p>

<p><i>"WHAT IS THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY?</p>

<p>The right to privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court has said that several of the amendments create this right. One of the amendments is the Fourth Amendment, which stops the police and other government agents from searching us or our property without "probable cause" to believe that we have committed a crime. Other amendments protect our freedom to make certain decisions about our bodies and our private lives without interference from the government </i>"</p>

<p>It seems that the Supremes would disagree with the Senator's Constitutional Law understanding.</p>

<p>You may have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom of consequences. The government cannot restrict your right to speech (within reason - fire in a crowded theater) but that doesn't mean that the public can't make judegements about you based on your speech.</p>

<p>Just as I judge the Dixie Chicks and Michael Moore, so I judge Senator Santorum. </p>

<p>Blithering idiot.</p>

<p>As a side note, this guy has a history of trying to force his morality into law and making statements as such:</p>

<p><a title="No Monkey Left Behind" href="http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/santorum.html">Evolution</a>.</p>

<p>Many people are aware of the stink I've raised over Jose Padilla and Mike Hawash. I'm also an ardent opposer of the "Patriot II" act that the Bush administration is trying to get through right now.</p>

<p>I was NOT however aware of this issue. It seems that John Ashcroft and the rest of this administration will go to ANY length to violate the constitution in its pursuit of safety. This cannot happen. Don't think that because you are a Democrat or a Republican that this will be shot down. You MUST contact the relevent congresscritters and do something about this. Both Republicans and Democrats would LOVE to be able to stiffle free speech and freedom of association to suit a specific set of goals. Currently that pesky Constitution is standing in the way. If they can strip you of citizenship based on some arbitrary association or statement or action, then they won't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Note this section from the article closely<br />
<i>The law states that a person's intent to relinquish his or her citizenship can be inferred from conduct. Indeed, the same conduct that constitutes the "expatriating act" – for example, the act of funding the Chechen orphanage – could provide a sufficient basis for concluding that the person intended to give up his or her citizenship. Although the person would be able to try to challenge this determination in court, he or she would not necessarily succeed.</i></p>

<p>Take heed people, you need to stand up for your freedoms as citizens of this country.</p>

<p>In the tradition of providing you with entertaining spam, here is the latest bit of poorly planned email.</p>


<pre>
Hi my name is David DeLanoy from 180Solutions Inc. I am contacting you because 180solutions would like
to bundle
n-CASE, our comparison-alternative shopping engine with your products, such as, Ari's Yahoo Client
1.10.
In return I will work with you to create a revenue package that will increase your monthly revenue.
If you are interested, please give me a call at 425-576-4239 or email me at ddelanoy@180solutions.com.

<p>In regards to distribution, typically the distributors bundle n-CASE in their existing setup programs<br />
or as a part of an upgrade,<br />
and then give their users the option to install n-CASE during setup. Currently over 60% of users opt to<br />
install n-CASE. In<br />
agreement, 180Solutions payes $.07 for every user who opts into installing n-CASE.</p>

<p>What is n-CASE? n-CASE is a Comparative Alternative Shopping Engine that 180Solutions has created to<br />
provide the user with more<br />
direct results in their search process. It is the most widely distributed application of its kind with<br />
over 16 million users worldwide.</p>

<p><br />
If you are interested in even more detailed information about us, please visit our site at:<br />
http://www.180solutions.com/?ref=dtd08</p>

<p><br />
If you are interested in working with us to provide your users with valuable software, as well as help<br />
generate revenue for<br />
your company  please contact me directly so that we can discuss working together. I look forward to<br />
hearing from you.</p>

<p>Respectfully,<br />
David DeLanoy<br />
ddelanoy@180Solutions.com<br />
425-576-4239<br />
</pre></p>

<p>Now showing that spammers and spyware creators are cut from the same cloth, David wants to do business with me!</p>

<p>A few points for David DeLanoy:</p>

<p>1) I'm just the technical contact for the domain where Ari's site is hosted. If you weren't just spamming whois records, you might know that.</p>

<p>2) Ari's Yahoo Client is a linux based product. Have you been so kind as to port your spyware to linux? Also, since Ari's Yahoo Client is under the GPL, you are aware that integrating your code would require that it be distributed under the selfsame license? I guess Ari, as original license grantor, could create a dual-license but it WOULD be interesting to get the source for some of this spyware to disable it.</p>

<p>3) This is a CONSOLE based program. What exactly are you spying on from the console? "My god Jim, this guy is running a screen session and an ssh session, let's send him an ad for tampons!"</p>

<p>Silly idiots. Don't bother the nice people.</p>

<p>This is just the text of those messages. While Bush and Blair express the same exact sentiment, I still love Tony Blair's speaking ability.</p>

<p>It's confirmed. I'm a Tony Blair groupie! </p>

<p>As to the meat of the message, I think these words were the BEST way to disarm any sort of "arab insecurity". The Arab community is an extremely prideful nation. While they wanted to see Saddam go, it hurts to see the most cocksure of Arab nations fall in fairly short order. I think both Bush and Blair made it clear that we will be out as soon as possible. Let's hope that holds true.</p>

Many people see this as a threat to the social bond and a sign of the failure of our integration model. This may well have been a significant factor in our government&apos;s decision to adopt its stance in the UN. Anything that would stir tensions between communities is regarded as a bad thing for our country. We already see too many people overtly supporting Saddam or shouting anti-semitic slogans in anti-war protests. And believe it or not, this is a real concern for us."

<p><a title="The Googlewashing Of Our Language" href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=59548&cid=5657709">The Googlewashing Of Our Language</a></p>


<p>Well the original story was about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/03/2327239&tid=95" title="googlewashing and second superpowers">Googlewashing</a> but it was in the context of the phrase "second superpower".</p>

<p>After reading the second superpower article, I had a bit of an itch to scratch. My language was probably less than productive but I really had to scratch! I got a wonderful response from ThinWhiteDuke who happens to be French.</p>

<p>As usual, I've quoted Thomas Jefferson way too much. I've also stepped outside of a rational discussion at some point with my choice of words .</p>

<p><i>A soldier serving with Number 1 Company 1st Battalion, of The Irish Guards pauses Thursday with his mug of tea after a sucessful raid on a large complex on the outskirts of Basra.</i></p>

<p>Now I want some hot tea with cream, damnit!</p>

<p>I randomly found this site on the web this afternoon and got sick to my stomach. I don't know anything about the guy only what I've read on the website and the linked <a title="Original Oregonian Article" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/104825159914540.xml">Oregonian website</a> as well as <a title="Letter to the Editor by Mike's friend" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/letters/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/104859701879330.xml">the letter to the editor</a> by one of his co-workers.</p>

<p>My understanding is that contributions he made to one of the charities that was later to be determined as funding terrorist activities is the reason behind this.</p>

<p>This really underscores a greater problem with the Patriot Act and John Ashcroft. That is the fact that he is a menace to this country and the Constitution of the United States, a document that I hold most dear to my heart. I also blame the congresscritters who allowed it to happen. </p>

<p>I don't care if this man was plotting to blow up the entire state of Oregon. He's a goddamned UNITED STATES CITIZEN. Doesn't that mean anything to anyone anymore? Oh wait, he's middle eastern. He's a terrorist. GET HIM! Forget the fact that he has rights confered to him as a UNITED STATES CITIZEN!</p>

<p>They may find out that he was actively involved in a plot to release a dirty bomb at Intel. I don't care. The fucking federal government has to operate within the fucking rules that were laid down in this country by people who left England to avoid this sort of thing. Due process you bastards. </p>

<p>I relish the day when we find out that the Red Cross has been indirectly sponsoring some sort of terrorist campaign. Then maybe we'll find a list of donors that has John Ashcroft on it. He might have some time to think about what he's done to this country while he's getting the living shit beat out of him by some overzelous FBI agent.</p>

<p>This whole post may land ME in a cell next to "Mike" Hawash. At least then I can apologize to him for wasting his time learning the Constitution and becoming a citizen. I'd rather KNOW that I'm living in fear under a dictator than having a false sense of security.</p>

<p>Do we really feel any safer?</p>

<p>Always providing me with good reads, Natalie Solent links to an Arab News article that will probably get the writer killed in some sort of Baath assasination.</p>
