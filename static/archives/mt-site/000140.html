<p>We own two. One is a 12 guage shotgun and the other is a 16. Make sure you have plenty of shells handy. Keep it by your bedside if you have to. Keep the gun lock on it to protect your children.</p>

<p>Now when you hear the bulldozers, look out your window. If they're not coming to tear down your house, but your neighbors, then go stand by your neighbor.</p>

<p>Alot of the above is extreme but it may come to that. Not today, not tomorrow but it will.</p>

<p>That is if things don't change.</p>

<p>Screw Republicans who support only big business and screw Democrats who thing the government should be all reaching.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theday.com/eng/web/news/re.aspx?re=0BFE6861-3C00-40D9-867C-09ADF6FDF468" title=New London, CT>You can read about it here</a></p>

<p>Our illustrious SCOTUS has ruled that governments can exercise eminent domain to increase a tax base.</p>

<p>This is what Justice Stevens, a Republican Justice, had to say:</p>

<quote>
“The city has carefully formulated an economic development that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including — but by no means limited to — new jobs and increased tax revenue,”
</quote>

<p>NOT LIMITED TO?!?!?!</p>

<p>What's next, taking property from a neighborhood because it's full of black families who don't pay as much in taxes as the white families who want it?</p>

<p>People who know me know that I am not sympathetic to poverty. I've been without a job and sleeping on a couch before. I'm also a capitalist. I'm all for the free market but goddamn it. We have inalienable rights. Or was that part torn out already? The government doesn't grant us those rights. They're inherent. The government's job is to ensure that we don't lose those rights.</p>

<p>Let me remind you of what the Declaration of Independance says:</p>

<p>-That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,</p>

<p>The fifth amendment says this:</p>

<p>"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."</p>

<p>By having expanded the definition of public use with today's ruling to include increased tax revenue and new jobs, no one is left with security that thier home is thier own. If your property value ever drops and a company like Pfiezer or Walmart wants to build a new greyfield, the government now has the ability to take that property on the fact that it might create new jobs.</p>

<p>Nevermind the string of buildings that Walmart leaves behind weekly to build a new SuperDooper Walmart 5 miles away.</p>

<p>Those of you who vote Republican, you are no better than those who vote Democrat. It's the same wolf with a different accent. I beg you. Consider the alternate parties. Consider voting Libertarian as I do. You may not agree with entire party line but rest assured that the purpose of the party platform is to ensure that individual rights enshirined by the Constitution are preserved. This sometimes means giving rights to people you can't stand or giving them the right to throw a punch but it also insures your right to have that punch stop before it hits you. </p>

<p>Read the Consitution. Read the Declaration of Independance. Read 1776. Understand what the hell we were fighting for and what people did to ensure that it happened. Understand it.  Live it. There are a ton of things that I think are wrong in this world. I think abortion is horrible and stupid and immoral but I would never support the overturning or weakening of Roe v. Wade. Why?</p>

<p>Simple, it is not the job of the government to enforce my personal moral code on someone else. I can understand the separatation of personal convictions vs.anothers rights.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of homosexual marriage but I will tell you this I would never want the government to deny someone the right to marry the person they want. Why? Because a free society doesn't do that sort of thing. </p>

<p>All of these things are one step away from total government control of my life and I don't want that. "I said nothing because they weren't coming for me. When they finally came for me there was no one to say anything"</p>

<p>Some things are not up for debate. My life, my liberty. Those are things you cannot take away. </p>

<p>You try and I'll be waiting. Waiting to stop the bulldozers. And I'll stand by you to stop the bulldozers too.</p>
