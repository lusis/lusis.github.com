<span class="title">Quick and dirty hack for PDF printing</span>

<p>I mentioned this on newsforge in response to the StarOffice article. I wanted to put a copy here for people who might not see that article.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>"The facts:</p>

<p>1 - We need to cut costs. <br />
2 - We have an occasional need to print to pdf format. <br />
3 - Adobe PDF writer is expensive. <br />
4 - What does John think we should do?</p>

<p>After thinking for a moment, I came to another set of facts.</p>

<p>1 - Under kde, I can print to pdf.<br />
2 - I need the same thing on a network.<br />
3 - Many printer drivers are postscript.<br />
4 - Ghostscript has a ps2pdf command.</p>

<p>How could I leverage this to my advantage?</p>

<p>I googled a bit for a solution. I found a couple of sample scripts but nothing that fit the bill exactly. Below you can find the script I use as well as a section from my smb.conf for the printer:<br />
<pre><br />
#!/bin/sh<br />
# I straight up stole this from somewhere on the web. I added alot of my own stuff. - JEV<br />
DATE=`date +%b%d-%H%M%S`</p>

<p>OUTDIR=/shr/pdfdropbox</p>

<p># take the input from a postscript printdriver and convert to pdf<br />
ps2pdf13 $1 $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.temp<br />
# optimize for quicker loading in Acrobat<br />
pdfopt $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.temp $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.pdf<br />
# Grab a snapshot in text format of the first page of the document to add to the email body<br />
pdftotext -f 1 -l 1 $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.pdf $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.txt<br />
# use mpack to mail the file along with using the first page of the document in <br />
# text format as the message body</p>

<p># this is fairly limited because it will only send to someone on OUR mailserver<br />
mpack -s ""PDF file - First page in message body"" -d $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.txt  \\<br />
$OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.pdf $2@yourdomainhere.com</p>

<p># clean up all the random shit we left lying around<br />
rm -rf $1 $OUTDIR/$2-$DATE.*<br />
</pre><br />
from smb.conf:<br />
<pre><br />
[PDF Printer]<br />
        comment = PDF Printer<br />
        path = /tmp<br />
        # force user = nobody<br />
        guest ok = Yes<br />
        printable = Yes<br />
        print command = /usr/bin/printpdf %s %U<br />
</pre><br />
You'll need mpack which you can get <a href=""http://www.pcc.com/~jay/src/mail_news/mpack-1.5/ORIGINALS/"">here</a>. You could do the same thing with metamail (as the link says) but I was in a hurry.</p>

<p>Under windows, we set up the printer as an HP Color LaserJet 5/5M PS. This is a good solid Postscript printer driver. Set it always to color and you're all set. Here's an example of the email it sends you. The text below is the body of the email message:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.lusis.org/samplepdf.pdf"">Here</a> is an example of the printed pdf. I only printed the first page and I also set it for landscape mode.</p>

<p>A few caveats:<br />
1 - Some fonts look like ass no matter what. This isn't an issue since the things we print to pdf are pretty standard.<br />
2 - No security whatsoever.This seems to be soley in the domain of Adobe. And we all know what to think of adobe and security eh?<br />
3 - No extra features. Like I said, this is a pretty limited and at the same time powerful solution. If you don't need a password protected pdf or any of the nifty indexing features, this is your tool.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone somewhere.</p>
