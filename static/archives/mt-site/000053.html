<p>I actually found something valuable from fuckedcompany.com.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>Check this post out:<br />
<a href="http://www.postget.com/get/article.php?newsid=90507">Corporate Communism</a></p>

<p>It's an interesting read and somewhat of a eye-opener for me. I had this mindset that capitalism was the perfect system. I don't feel that way anymore. </p>

<p>Note this quote from the article:<br />
<i>But while capitalism is the best system, it isn't a perfect system.</i></p>

<p>I thought about that line for a minute. I can see flaws in capitalism. Check this quote:</p>

<p><i>Left unfettered, what starts slowly as the many fit swallowing the many weak, continues like a snowball, without stopping until a very few bloated giants are left standing. Over time, companies are able to leverage small advantages into humongous advantages. That's why anti-trust laws were created to begin with.</i></p>

<p> Without competition, companies have no reason to improve. With competition, the consumer is the ultimate winner.</p>

<p>I never really reconciled the Sherman Act with my personal feelings on capitalism. I understood it fully and what it was intended to do but never made that tiny link. Today, after reading this article, something clicked.</p>

<p>The natural course of capitalism is that eventually you are left with a monopoly. Those are not illegal as long as competition still has room to thrive. After all, by nature and definition of competition is that someone is that someone comes out on top. Good sportsmanship aside, there is a winner.</p>

<p>As long as the winner is willing to accept new challenges and play fair, capitalism works. The reason we needed the anti-trust laws is that the winner decided he didn't like the rules that allowed him to become the winner.</p>

<p>Read the article. While it's about a specific situation, it has truths that apply to anyone that believes in the power of a free market and the right of the individual to decide for himself.</p>
