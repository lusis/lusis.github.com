<p>Michelle and I were talking about the whole Dixie Chick's fiasco and we ended up on public opinion and private rights.</p>


<p>I ended up on this thread on google groups:</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=lang_en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&threadm=2rf97v0me4svdfdn23ek2g781cf36nf8em%404ax.com&rnum=3&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dprivate%2Bbusiness%2B%252B%2Bno%2Bservice%2B%252B%2Bdiscrimination%26hl%3Den%26lr%3Dlang_en%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26safe%3Doff%26scoring%3Dd%26selm%3D2rf97v0me4svdfdn23ek2g781cf36nf8em%25404ax.com%26rnum%3D3">Google Groups</a></p>

<p>We were discussing how people will discriminate based on political opinion and such. I think the whole boycott of the Dixie Chicks is stupid and that people place to high an opinion on what celebs say. I'm of the opinion that discrimination is fine by a private business or individual is totally legit as it holds to private property rights. The courts have typically agreed with the exception of certain protected classes. One quote really jumped out at me though:</p>

<p>"Service can legally be refused for _proselytizing_ one's religion (and<br />
refusing to stop when so ordered), but that's different from _having_<br />
a religious belief (even if that belief requires proselytizing)."</p>
