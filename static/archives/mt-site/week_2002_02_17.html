<p>"Looks like Be/Palm finally got off the collective ass and did the right thing.</p>

<p>Finally something as verifiable proof that Microsoft abused its monopoly. The BeOS bootloader issue is one of the biggest smoking guns (in my book) ever regarding the issue. Read about it on the link above.<br />

<span class="title">Postfix is now running</span>

<p>I finally got postfix all configured.</p>


<p>I've got the rules pretty tight on what can and can't get through. If you get any information about mail getting rejected for whatever reason, forward it to postmaster at lusis.org.</p>

<p>I've stopped short of subscribing to an RBL list. I want to see how much spam I can block by stopping things like servers that don't have a valid HELO client name or whatnot. Again if anyone who has an email account on the server is having problems, just drop me a line.  I'll also accept sample configs from various people that might have example access files and main.cf's that have been succesful in blocking the majority of UCE. I'll be glad to post them here for others to download as well.<br />
