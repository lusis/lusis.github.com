What&rsquo;s worse is I&rsquo;ve been sitting on it for months.
When I started Noah a few years ago, I had a head full of steam. I had some grand ideas but was trying to keep things realistic. I simply wanted a simple REST-ish interface for stashing nuggets of information between systems and a flexible way to notify interested parties when that information changed.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 20, 2013</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/12/17/how-we-vagrant/>How We Vagrant</a></h2><div><p>People may or may not have noticed but I&rsquo;ve been largely offline for the past 4 weeks or so. This is because I&rsquo;ve been in the middle of a pretty heavy redesign of a few key parts of our application stack. This also required me to learn Java so I&rsquo;ve been doubly slammed.
As part of that redesign, I worked on what we lovingly refer to internally as the &ldquo;solo installer&rdquo;.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 17, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/07/09/what-production-means/>What Production Means</a></h2><div><p>This post is something that&rsquo;s been brewing for a while. While it may sound targeted in tone, it&rsquo;s more general than that. Let&rsquo;s just call it an open letter to family, friends and coworkers around the world.
One thing that I have the hardest time communicating to friends and family who aren&rsquo;t in the IT industry is the concept of &ldquo;production&rdquo; and what it means to be on-call. Even coworkers have a hard time understanding what it means.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 9, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/06/15/why-ebs-was-a-bad-idea/>Why Ebs Was a Bad Idea</a></h2><div><p>Since I just tweeted about this and I know people would want an explaination, I figured I&rsquo;d short circuit 140 character hell and explain why I think EBS was the worst thing Amazon ever did to AWS.

Now for sure what spawned this comment was something unrelated but it got me thinking.

Netflix still does operations Regardless of what words Adrian uses, Netflix still does operations. John Allspaw summed it up pretty well in this tweet:
and here are the things, he mentions:

I&rsquo;ve addressed this topic a bit before here. At the time it was addressing specifically dynamic languages. However the post that Kohsuke wrote (and the post that inspired it) have led me to a new line attitude.
Don&rsquo;t bother trying to get your packages into upstream vendor distros

I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the type of companies I end up working for or what but I always seem to find myself ass-deep in Maven.
please note that I&rsquo;m drifiting into deeply unfamiliar territory for me. Someone once told me the best way to learn about something is to write about it.

That night we decided to take it a bit further and add support for ZeroMQ as a filter plugin as well.
I&rsquo;ve had a lot of people ask me what&rsquo;s so hot about ZeroMQ. It&rsquo;s hard to explain but I really would suggest you read the excellent zguide.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 8, 2012</time></div></article></div><div class=paginator><p>Page 3 of 5</p><div class=paginator-group><a class=color-link href=/page/2/><svg width="13" height="9" viewBox="0 0 13 9" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g class="color-arrow" fill="#63bda2" fill-rule="nonzero"><polygon id="Path" points="1.75929935 4.50000282 5.3292523 7.62371165 4.6707477 8.37628835 0.240700645 4.49999718 4.67081049 0.623709205 5.32930951 1.37629079"/><polygon id="Path" points="13 4 13 5 1 5 1 4"/></g></svg>Newer</a>
