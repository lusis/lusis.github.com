Edit and update Evidently my testing missed a pretty critical usecase - pubsub. It doesn&rsquo;t work right now. Due to the way we&rsquo;re doing sockopts works for setting topics. However we don&rsquo;t have a commensurate setting on the PUB side.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 6, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/01/31/load-balancing-logstash-with-amqp/>Load Balancing Logstash With Amqp</a></h2><div><p>AMQP in Logstash is one of the most complicated parts of the workflow. I&rsquo;ve taken it on myself, as the person with the most AMQP experience (both RabbitMQ and Qpid) to try and explain as much as need for logstash users.
Patrick DeBois hit me up with a common logstash design pattern that I felt warranted a full detailed post.

To me this, is the crux of what makes Logstash so awesome. Someone asked me to describe Logstash in one sentence. The best I could come up with was:

I&rsquo;m a fairly active Twitter user.
Patrick has joked that it&rsquo;s as if I have Twitter wired directly to my brain. It&rsquo;s not far from the truth. I like to engage people and normally Twitter is great medium for engaging folks. Unfortunately, the message size limit makes Twitter an imperfect medium for involved discussions.
I know better but sometimes I forget.
Anyway, last friday I realized near the end of the day that I had pretty much gone off the rails.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 22, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/deploy-all-the-things/>Deploy All the Things</a></h2><div><p><p><em>This is part 2 in a post on deployment strategies. The previous post is located <a href=http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/rollbacks-and-other-deployment-myths/>here</a></em></p><p>My previous post covered some of the annoying excuses and complaints that people like to use when discussing deployments. The big take away should have been the following:</p><ul><li>The risk associated with deploying new code is not in the deploy itself but everything you did up to that point.</li><li>The way to make deploying new code less risky is to do it more often, not less.</li><li>Create a culture and environment that enables and encourages small, frequent releases.</li><li>Everything fails. Embrace failure.</li><li>Make deploys trivial, automated and tolerant of failure.</li></ul><p>I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I&rsquo;ve said this several times before. You can get 90% of the way to a fully automated environment, never go that last 10% and still be better off than you were before. I understand that people have regulations, requirements and other things that prevent a fully automated system. You don&rsquo;t ever have to flip that switch but you should strive to get as close as possible.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 18, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/rollbacks-and-other-deployment-myths/>Rollbacks and Other Deployment Myths</a></h2><div><p><p>I came across an interesting post today via HN.

As I was checking my Github feed tonight (as I&rsquo;ve been known to do on occassion), I saw an update for a project that I was watching. This project is, for all intents and purposes, a redo of Capistrano with some additional system management stuff on top. From the description:
