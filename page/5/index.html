This is a really long post</em></p><p>In the course of rewriting the <a href=https://github.com/lusis/Noah>Noah</a> callback daemon, I started to get really frustrated with EventMachine. This is nothing against EventMachine by any stretch of the imagination. I really like it.</p><p>What I was having issues with is making the plugin framework as dirt simple as possible. By using EM, I had no choice but to require folks to understand how EM works. This primarily meant not blocking the reactor. Additionally, through no fault of EM, I was starting to get mired in callback spaghetti.</p><h1 id=actors>Actors</h1><p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned several times before that I love the actor model. It makes sense to me. The idea of mailboxes and message passing is really simple to understand. For a while, there was project that implemented actors on top of EM called Revactor but it stalled. I started following the author (Tony Arcieri) on GitHub to see if he would ever update it. He did not but I caught wind of his new project and it was pretty much exactly what I was looking for.</p><p>Actors have a proven track record in Erlang and the Akka framework for Scala and Java uses them as well.</p><h1 id=celluloid>Celluloid</h1></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 13, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/08/13/migrating-from-blogger/>Migrating From Blogger</a></h2><div><p><p>Many, many years ago I started blogging. It&rsquo;s fun and I like to feel self-important by dumping my ideas. I enjoy writing so blogging is cool like that.</p><p>Over the past 12 years I&rsquo;ve gone through various tools to help me do that (in no particular order):</p><ul><li>PHPnuke</li><li>Postnuke</li><li>Moveable Type</li><li>Plone</li><li>CakePHP</li><li>rst2html vim plugin</li><li>Blogger</li><li>Wordpress</li><li>Homegrown shit</li></ul><p>With the exception of one, all of these tools were simply a pain in the ass. They required lots of moving pieces, we&rsquo;re bug ridden and security nightmares.
The one tool I enjoyed the most?</p><p>rst2html in Vim</p><p>The only reason I used those tools was because I hated writing HTML. I hated dealing with styling. About 3 years ago I finally settled on using Blogger. Now I&rsquo;m changing again.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 13, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/07/21/monitoring-sucks-watch-your-language/>Monitoring Sucks Watch Your Language</a></h2><div><p><p><em>The following post is a recap of what was discussed in the 07/21/11 #monitoringsucks irc meeting</em></p><p>Before I get any further, I just want to thank everyone who attended,
either in virtual person or in spirit. There have been so many awesome
discussions going around this topic since we started. I am truly
priviledged to interact with each and every one of you. I struggle to
count myself a peer and I can only hope that I provide something in
return.</p><p>I mentioned to someone today that I’m literally sick of the current
landscape. I consider the current crop of monitoring solutions to be
technologically bankrupt. The situation is fairly untenable at this
point.</p><p>I just installed (after having a total loss of an existing Zenoss setup)
Nagios again. I’m not joking when I say that it depressed the everliving
hell out of me. The monitoring landscape simply has not kept up with
modern developments. At first it was mildly frustrating. Then it was
annoying. Now it’s actually a detriment.</p><p>Now that we have that out of the way….</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 21, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/06/05/why-monitoring-sucks/>Why Monitoring Sucks</a></h2><div><p><p><em>(and what we&rsquo;re doing about it)</em></p><p>About two weeks ago someone made a tweet. At this point, I don&rsquo;t
remember who said it but the gist was that &ldquo;monitoring sucks&rdquo;. I
happened to be knee-deep in frustrating bullshit around that topic and
was currently evaluating the same effing tools I&rsquo;d evaluated at every
other company over the past 10 years or so. So I did what seems to be
S.O.P for me these days. I started something.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 5, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/05/20/on-noah-part-4/>On Noah Part 4</a></h2><div><p><p><em>This is the fourth part in a series on Noah. <a href=http://goo.gl/l3Mgt>Part 1</a>, <a href=http://goo.gl/Nj2TN>Part 2</a> and <a href=http://goo.gl/RsZtZ>Part 3</a> are available as well</em></p><p>In Part 1 and 2 of this series I covered background on Zookeeper and

a way to learn Erlang. However this did not work out. I needed to get a
proof of concept out much quicker than the ramp up time it would take to
<a href=http://learnyousomeerlang.com/>learn me some Erlang</a>. I had this
grandiose idea to slap mnesia, riak_core and webmachine into a tasty
